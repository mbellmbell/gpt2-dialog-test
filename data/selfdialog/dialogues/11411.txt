"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is your favorite NFL player of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to say its Brett Favre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because he didnt quit until he was old, the dude is an inspiration."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite player of all time is Peyton Manning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a solid choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was so awesome to see him win a Super Bowl on the way out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah that was a fairytale ending for him, I have to admit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm also glad he retired when he did though, I dont think he would have survived another season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that is how Tom Brady will go out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Winning a Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, playing one season too many and getting some horrific injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah I can see that, him at age 45 getting flattened by some linebacker and breaking everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that would be fine, I really dislike Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think nearly everyone does, except for people in Boston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the best quarterback this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dont know, there are a lot of great quarterbacks in the league, I think Marcus Mariota could have a great year if he says healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Dak Prescott?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That guy is a flash in the pan, he's going to end up like Colin Kapernick who was worthless once defenses figured him out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah good point, he's had some good games but I think you might be right about that."
