"__MOVIES__ So that's what happened in that mnovie."
"__MOVIES__ Um. Didn't you say you watched it?"
"__MOVIES__ yes. but it was hard to follow because I didn't watch the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Eh, the polot is kinda convoluted with a lot of new characters in the sequel. so even if you watched the first one, it would still be kinda weird."
"__MOVIES__ What do they call those gun shooting scenes? Gun Fu?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. began in Hong Kong movie scenes. Not sure who originated the term Gun Fu though, and I kinda don't care."
"__MOVIES__ But it's so total bad ass. Like gun is used almost as a prop for martial arts. Totally surreal"
"__MOVIES__ John Woo is the one who more or less invented that genre"
"__MOVIES__ Too bad all his movies are more or less the same."
"__MOVIES__ He lacks imagination in plot development."
"__MOVIES__ yeah, but his version of mission impossible sucked too. He's just not that great at directing."
"__MOVIES__ We all get old and peoole get tired of what we do. It's just life."
"__MOVIES__ So the part three is gonna be when?"
"__MOVIES__ They're making it now I think. So next year? Or the year after?"
"__MOVIES__ I bet it's goign to be the final one where John Wick dies after he dismantles the High Table for good."
"__MOVIES__ That would fit the image of our hero."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, totally, like, all he's ever wanted was a quiet life with his wife. Now she's dead, puppy too, and the car's stolen. And taking the revenge on all that made him a marker"
"__MOVIES__ Well Santino had the marker on him which he wasn't supposed to use unless someone come out of retirement."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, so that's what happened to John wick>? it was killing those who killed his puppy that made him available again or, however you want to describe it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Santino couldn't have demanded the marker from Wick had Wick not killed the Russian mob for killing his puppy. it would've stayed buried. That's where the irony is. Demaning justice for John demands more injustices for John. It's an instant classic."
