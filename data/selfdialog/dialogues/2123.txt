"__MUSIC__ Are the Red Hot Chili Peppers ever going to not be cool?"
"__MUSIC__ I think not. Those guys kill it years after years."
"__MUSIC__ Their latest album is awesome. Have you heard it?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't. I have just heard random new songs here and there."
"__MUSIC__ You should dedicate an hour and a half and listen to it completely"
"__MUSIC__ You know, I kind of lost my pasion for them since John Frusciante left."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I also feel his absence. But the new guy is very good."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure he must be great if the rest of the band chose him as John's substitution. But it is not the same."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's right. This guy has his own style, but the passion John Frusciante put in is incomparable."
"__MUSIC__ He could solo like nobody. He was a free soul with a guitar that could express tons of emotion."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. But the band still has their funk going."
"__MUSIC__ Well, with Anthony, Flea and Chad still going strong I don't think the essence can be lost."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. I mean they are kind of crazy to look at now a days, but they can inspire anyone."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ You look at these guys and they are all our age and still jumping around and banging their heads. It's crazy."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's what a young spirit does. We should go to a concert like we did back in the days and test our own necks."
"__MUSIC__ I would absolutely love that. Count me in."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know when they will be near us?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know but if we go on their website I'm sure we'll find out right away."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I'll check and let you know."
