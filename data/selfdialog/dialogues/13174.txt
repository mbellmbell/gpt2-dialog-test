"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had a dream last night about watching NFL football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that's all we got right now since the season hasn't started."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking of trying to go to a game this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where would you go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Bears, but I'd be open to anywhere really."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You must really want to attend a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do.  I used to have season tickets to the Bears and I miss those Sundays tailgating and going into the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like a fun way to spend a Sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do enjoy being home too though to watch NFL games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That NFL Redzone Channel is great to watch parts of all the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know you don't really miss a touchdown on that channel."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now you're getting me excited to watch my team the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't know you were a Steelers fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've liked them for awhile.  I liked Antonio Brown and their running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You talking about LeVeon Bell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I couldn't remember his name.  He is a great runner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is very explosive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Antonio Brown can move too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he just runs by defenseive backs and Big Ben drops the ball in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ See why I like the Steelers!"
