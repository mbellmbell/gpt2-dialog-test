"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I cannot wait to see my Vikings, Saints and Seahawks play!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like three teams, well that is certainly something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gives me better odds that one of them wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playing the numbers game right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's more of the fact that my favorite players are on those teams, I am not really loyal to a specific team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you root more for the players instead of the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I just find it better that way, it gets me more invested in the game, it also gives me more games to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't fault you for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about you, who are you rooting for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a true blue Cowboys fan, have been ever since my youth."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ America's team huh? They are really back in contention now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are, but I am still sad that we could not win one with Romo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he had so much talent, just could not get one for Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well now we have a great overall team, I think he could do a lot with the personnel if he was our quarterback still."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too, that team is built to contend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway we should go to a bar and watch a game sometime this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like fun, I would love too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and knowing how many teams you like we will find a game easily."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we'll make sure the Cowboys are also playing."
