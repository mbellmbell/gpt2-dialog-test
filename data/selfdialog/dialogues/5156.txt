"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Man, can you believe they've come out with eight Fast & Furious movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hey man, if it works, I don't see why they should stop making them. Fast 7 and the Fate of the Furious both grossed over a billion dollars."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Jeez, don't you think they're kind of milking the franchise? I mean, I can't see them making any more movies without Paul Walker."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Not really, if it's not broken, don't fix it. Anyways, do you happen to have a favorite Fast & Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Honestly, I really like the first The Fast and the Furious movie. I have vivid memories of it because my dad took me to see it on my birthday."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Good choice man, but I'd have to say Fast 7 was my favorite movie. I really like the soundtrack too, See You Again is a great song."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Don't you think that song is a little played out? Charlie Puth sounds like generic pop to me."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think that's a little disrespectful to say man, the song is a real touching tribute to Paul Walker's memory. Brian will forever be immortalized by that song."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No disrespect to Paul Walker, I'm just a little tired of hearing that song everyday on the radio."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I see what you mean, and respect your entitlement to an opinion. If they keep coming out with movies, I'll keep watching them till Fast 70 is out and I'm an 82-year-old grandpa!"
