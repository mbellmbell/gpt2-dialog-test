"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Marshawn coming back to play for the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's great. Really. Beast mode. I think it's good for the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. I just hope he still has his legs. You know, folks saying he's getting older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I can understand that. I guess we'll see. I'm thinking it's good he got a few years rest. Maybe he's still got some juice in him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Beast mode! I'm just pumped. I think he adds a level of fun to the game that before the NFL has tried to stop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Agreed. I'm just worried things might get out of hand in Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh. I know, right? Those are some sick fans. Still, it's gotta be good for the community. Folks seeing that he came from the city. All that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. My only real beef with Oakland is that stadium. Man, that place is a dump."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. It's unfortunate. Even worse. Now they'll be leaving for Vegas. Who can really blame them, though. It's a true dump."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. You think players will get into trouble in Vegas? I mean, with betting and the lifestyle and all that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. Not really anything more than the usual. I bet they'll have some good parties, though. Maybe some better stories about going out to the club."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! Agreed. I think it'll be alright, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully Carr is healthy this year. Just a shame about the injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. It's too bad. But yeah, things are looking good for the Silver and Black."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Raider Nation!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha! A true fan, ay? That's cool. I just want to see them compete. Play hard. All that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not me. I want them to push farther than last year at least. It ended up a disappointing season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I disagree. I think it just show how important it is to have depth. Obvious example, look at Dallas."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, true. Dak was just ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. But I mean, that's why I think it's just key to have depth. Even at QB."
