"__MOVIES__ Do you like going to movie theaters to watch movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I have not been to a movie theater in quite a few years."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ I prefer watching new movies at home where I can be comfortable."
"__MOVIES__ That takes away from the feel of going to a movie theater though."
"__MOVIES__ Well yes, but sometimes people can be really loud when I am trying to watch a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, sometimes, but it is not always like that."
"__MOVIES__ I have thought about going to the theaters in the fall."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything you are going to see?"
"__MOVIES__ A new movie is coming out in September that I want to see."
"__MOVIES__ Do you prefer watching Netflix movies when at home?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think they have a great selection of movies."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, they are pretty quick to add new movies to it as well."
"__MOVIES__ That is how I have seen most new movies since I do not go to theaters much."
"__MOVIES__ I think action movies are the best to watch in a movie theater."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the sound is phenomenal, feels like it shakes you in your seat when some parts are intense."
"__MOVIES__ That is one thing I do like, I must agree. The sound is amazing in a theater."
"__MOVIES__ There are movies I have seen in theater that I enjoyed more than watching at home."
"__MOVIES__ You're right on that, I need to go to the theaters more then!"
