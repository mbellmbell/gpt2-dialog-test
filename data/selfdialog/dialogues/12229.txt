"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the craziest play you have ever heard of in NFL history?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I'd have to say it was the game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders in 1972."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats an incredibly old game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it's way before your time but let me tell you. You'll never see another play like that ever,"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what happened in this game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pittsburgh was down 7 to 6 with 22 seconds left and had a fourth and tenth situation at their 40 line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds like a bad situation."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh it was, If I was on the team at that time I'd assume it's game over at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what happened next?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The quarterback which was Terry Bradshaw at the time threw a pass intended for one of his teammates I can't remember who."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I take it he didn't find his mark?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No the throw got blocked by one of the raiders and the ball went flying off screen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then what happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of the steelers Franco Harris I believe managed to catch the ball keeping it in play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes sir, he then sprinted his way to the goal making his team take the lead with 5 seconds left on the clock."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is amazing I'll have to look up that play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was such an impossible play that it's been named 'The Immaculate Reception'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's pretty funny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was an amazing thing to see. Like I said that will never happen again in the NFL."
