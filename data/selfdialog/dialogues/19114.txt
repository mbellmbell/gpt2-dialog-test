"__MOVIES__ Do you think that criminals should be able to act and direct?"
"__MOVIES__ Who, specifically?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Mel Gibson is a horrible person. Sean Penn tortured Madonna. Alec Baldwin is an awful parent. Casey Affleck got best actor amid sex assault accusations."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Because they can get away with anything. What do you think happens to a poor person who is caught stealing?"
"__MOVIES__ Jail."
"__MOVIES__ Not just that. Some states had a 'three strikes' policy and there are poor people serving life sentences for stealing three items."
"__MOVIES__ That's insane."
"__MOVIES__ So, do you think Mel Gibson should be able to direct movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they're oscar-worthy. He does a great job."
"__MOVIES__ True, but that just feeds into the 'special class' of movie stars."
"__MOVIES__ My only thing is that they're an inspiration. They don't get treated as real people because they're not."
"__MOVIES__ They are."
"__MOVIES__ No, not really. They're icons and have an extra status."
"__MOVIES__ So you're fine with it?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw and loved Hacksaw Ridge. I loved Manchester By The Sea. They shouldn't be stopped from doing their craft."
"__MOVIES__ You don't care if they commit crimes?"
"__MOVIES__ No, of course I do. I just think that after they serve their time, they can get back to their jobs."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds okay, but again shows them as special."
"__MOVIES__ And, again, they are special."
