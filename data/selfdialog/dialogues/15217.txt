"__HARRY_POTTER__ Have you read the Cursed Child screenplay yet?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it wasn't quite what I expected."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you mean?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I expected it to be more like the novels. Harry didn't interact as much with his kids as I expected either."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, the focus was supposed to be on his youngest son."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sure, but there just wasn't enough interaction between the two different generations."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It had to be concise, though. It's a screenplay, not a novel."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess you're right. I just wish there were more."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There could be at some point. They could make it into a movie and then a novel."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That would be awesome."
