"__MUSIC__ I'm really into 90's music right now. Have you ever heard of Pearl Jam?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I was in high school in the 90's so I listened to Pearl Jam a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I didn't think they were that popular."
"__MUSIC__ They were, in the 90's. I listened to a lot of grunge music."
"__MUSIC__ What's grunge music. I said Pearl Jam."
"__MUSIC__ Pearl Jam is grunge. It was a big style in 90's music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah. I think I read something about that on Tumblr."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, let me help you out. You like Pearl Jam?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've been listening to them non-stop lately."
"__MUSIC__ Then write down these band names too. Nirvana, Soul Asylum, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, Alice in Chains."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I've heard of Nirvana! I haven't listened to them though."
"__MUSIC__ You should, especially their MTV Unplugged."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. MTV is ok, but my mom won't let me watch because she hates that show Teen Mom."
"__MUSIC__ Don't worry. MTV used to be a lot different, this was a music show."
"__MUSIC__ Ok cool. I'll have to make Spotify playlist later with all these bands."
"__MUSIC__ You should! I think you'll really like them, also try Stone Temple Pilots and Sonic Youth."
"__MUSIC__ I love this, my parents don't listen to any cool music."
"__MUSIC__ You might be surprised, but that shoould get you set up for awhile."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know I listen to a lot of music, I'll go through this pretty quick."
"__MUSIC__ Then let me tell you about Riot Grrrl."
