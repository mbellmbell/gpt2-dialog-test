"__MOVIES__ Do you think 'The Dark Knight' was the best Batman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That is a tough question to answer.  There were so many good Batman movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, unless you exclude 'Batman Forever.'"
"__MOVIES__ Of course.  I assumed that was a given."
"__MOVIES__ So besides that one, which would you choose?"
"__MOVIES__ I think my favorite was 'Batman Begins.'  It made Batman cool again."
"__MOVIES__ It did redeem the franchise after 'Batman Forever.'"
"__MOVIES__ I guess yours is 'The Dark Knight?'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  I thought Christopher Nolan was such a perfect director."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that the whole trilogy was based on realism."
"__MOVIES__ It also kept the darkness that was set as precedent during the first Batman movie."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the one with Michael Keaton?  I agree."
"__MOVIES__ While Nolan's movies get my vote, I will give an honorable mention to Ben Affleck as Batman."
"__MOVIES__ But 'Batman v Superman' was so bad."
"__MOVIES__ It was bad.  But I think that their Batman was the truest to form, in regards to the comics."
"__MOVIES__ I am unfamiliar with the comics."
"__MOVIES__ Well like Ben Affleck portrayed him in the movie, comic book Batman is crazier and more obsessed with the war against crime."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the only thing then that wasn't true to the comics with Ben Affleck's Batman was that he killed criminals."
"__MOVIES__ Good point.  That's like Batman's most important rule."
"__MOVIES__ His one rule in fact.  Regardless, I'm excited to see what the studios have in store for Batman next."
