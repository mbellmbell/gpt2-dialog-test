"__STAR_WARS__ Can you see the Star Wars franchise ending"
"__STAR_WARS__ They have no movies in the pipeline passed the 9th edition"
"__STAR_WARS__ They could always be doing more just not in the planning phase"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I think they may just retire and go out on top"
"__STAR_WARS__ That probably wont be the case."
"__STAR_WARS__ They always do seem to bank on these movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think they need all new characters"
"__STAR_WARS__ They did introduce them in the force awakens"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but they are still holding onto the original cast"
"__STAR_WARS__ So you want C3PO out too? You are nuts!"
