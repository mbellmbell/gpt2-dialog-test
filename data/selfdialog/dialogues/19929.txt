"__MOVIES__ You know, I am tired of a lot of movies they come out with these days."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ They are either essentially a remake of an old story, or full of crude humor."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Sometimes I feel like Hollywood is running out of ideas for good movies."
"__MOVIES__ I have started to watch a lot of movies from before our time and I am really enjoying them."
"__MOVIES__ How old are we talking here?"
"__MOVIES__ Well lately I have been on a Doris Day kick."
"__MOVIES__ What is the most recent movie of hers that you watched?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched Pillow Talk just the other day."
"__MOVIES__ That has Rock Hudson in it as well, right?"
"__MOVIES__ It sure does. What a classic combo!"
"__MOVIES__ They were very good together."
"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite older movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess I would have to say State Fair."
"__MOVIES__ That is an old one, but a good one!"
"__MOVIES__ I really like the way of life from back then. It seemed simpler."
"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about musicals?"
"__MOVIES__ I like them. I haven't seen too many though."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoy South Pacific. I think it is a fantastic movie."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will have to try to watch that one."
