"__STAR_WARS__ I read somewhere that the first Star Wars movie was based on classic mythology."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Joseph Campbell's The Power of Myth details the elements of classic myth, and Star Wars (I don't call it A New Hope, that's for youngsters) hits all of them."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the classic myth elements are what made it such a strong story. You can't beat story structure that's been used for 3000 years, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Read Campbell's Hero with a Thousand Faces and the parallels become really obvious. A young hero called to adventure, training with a Mentor, going on a journey."
"__STAR_WARS__ This is great stuff. And Lucas modernized the hero myth in order to reach a 20th century audience in a visual medium."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. I remember when the film first came out. It was such a sensation - it played in theaters for over a year, which in this day and age would be amazing, unbelievable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was back in the days when there weren't DVDs and Netflix rentals."
"__STAR_WARS__ I must have seen the movie in a theater over a dozen times, because it was so entertaining. Heck, I saw it two times in a row the first time I saw it - I hid in the bathroom between showings and went right back in for the second go round."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it really changed the way science fiction was presented in movies. Everybody wanted to do a Star Wars type film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even the second trilogy wanted to be the first trilogy, in the sense of setting a precedent, awe and wonder. But Lucas tried to do it with special effects instead of a good solid story, which is why the prequel trilogy sucked so hard."
