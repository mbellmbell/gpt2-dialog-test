"__BEATLES__ I've never seen this album before."
"__BEATLES__ It's called 'Love Songs', it came out in 1977."
"__BEATLES__ Can you get this on CD?"
"__BEATLES__ No, it's never been released on CD?"
"__BEATLES__ I bet it's worth a lot of money."
"__BEATLES__ Not really, I only paid ten dollars for that copy about seven years ago. Maybe in twenty or thirty years it will be worth a lot."
"__BEATLES__ Are the records in good condition or do they skip a lot?"
"__BEATLES__ They're in good condition, and I really don't play that album a lot. I already have all those songs on my MP3 player."
"__BEATLES__ Do you mind if we listen to it now?"
"__BEATLES__ No, we have time."
