"__RAP_HIPHOP__ If you can only choose one hip-hop artist to listen to ,who is it gonna be?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ it's gotta be Lil Uzi Vert"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ may I ask why?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ well, simply speaking, his songs got good vibe, good company when I'm doing work"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm not surprised, he got quite few songs on the top list of billboards"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ yea, what song you like from him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can't remember, but I'm listening to XO TOUR LIFT3 recently from him"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ oh, that's a very chill music, afternoon vibe"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ now that you mentioned it, I indeed feel it's an afternoon vibe, lazy and energetic at the same time"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ yes indeed!"
