"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Bills chances?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No chance at all.  They have a good defense and rushing but not much else."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they need to keep with a coach for maybe five minutes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, every time you change systems it makes playing harder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially against a team that's have the same coach for nearly two decades."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, have fun beating the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bills also need a QB.  I'm not on board with Tyrod Taylor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Truthfully me neither.  Overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are stuck in that dreaded middle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see where you're going.  Not good enough to move forward, too good to get good picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, free agents don't see them as worthy, and drafting in the middle so they can't get those franchise players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they need to draft better too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Start with finding a good quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, a pocket passer might be nice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And can you believe they let Hogan get away?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh I know.  Now he's living it up on the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a monster out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what happens when you have a good QB throwing to you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, Brady makes a difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a deep receiving corps.  When everyone is doubling Gronk or Eddleman you're always wide open."
