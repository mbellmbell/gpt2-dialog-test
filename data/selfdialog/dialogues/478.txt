"__MUSIC__ Hey, have you heard any good songs lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was just listening to that song Drinking Problem on the country station."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that one has great lyrics!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and a good tune, too.  It's by Midland."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's probably because Drinking Problem is their debut single."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe they'll have more good music in the future."
"__MUSIC__ I guess it's possible.  Their first album came out in 2016 but I don't think it's done too well."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the only popular song from it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, so far.  So that's not a good sign."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I would think there'd be at least several good songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  And sales on the album haven't been too great."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm.  Well at least that one song is good!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, true.  Have you heard anything else good lately?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I've been listening to some older country stuff.  Some Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean."
"__MUSIC__ I love Jason Aldean!  That Any ol Barstool song is great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it has a great tune and lyrics.  I love it too."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of his music is great, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, definitely.  He's had more success than Midlands."
"__MUSIC__ That's for sure!"
