"__MOVIES__ I just watched Get Out. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watched it about a month ago. Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was overrated. Don't get me wrong, it was good. But not as good as I was expecting."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that? What was wrong with it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really slow."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I can understand why you would say that."
"__MOVIES__ There was a good amount of time in the first half where nothing really happened."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think that's because the writer was building it up."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but that made it really boring."
"__MOVIES__ True. But the ending was good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, once it picked up it got really good."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't expect it to be what it was. I thought it was going to be more like Stepford Wives."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I expected them to turn the people into robots."
"__MOVIES__ I think Jordan Peele is a good writer and director. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next."
"__MOVIES__ I believe he said he was going to make more horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ I wish he'd make a comedy. I really liked Keanu."
"__MOVIES__ The movie about the lost cat?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was funny."
"__MOVIES__ It was! I wasn't expecting it to be so good."
"__MOVIES__ Me either. It was a surprise."
