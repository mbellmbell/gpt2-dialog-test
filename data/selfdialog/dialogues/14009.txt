"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see that Boston got the number 1 pick in the NBA draft?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, at least something went right for them this week!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know! Cleveland has just destroyed them so far in the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ On their own home court!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Looks like LaBron is on a mission again."
"__BASKETBALL__ I wonder if they will even lose a game the way they're going!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well,  the Golden State Warriors might have something to say about that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Indeed.  Everyone handed them the championship before the season started."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. But now I'm not so sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not kidding. When LaBron plays like this, he's just a force of nature."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know I'm not getting in his way."
"__BASKETBALL__ Can you imagine taking a charge from him when he's got a head of steam up?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No way. That's gotta hurt."
"__BASKETBALL__ But poor Boston. They were probably feeling pretty good about themselves."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. They've squandered home court advantage, and it hasn't even been close."
"__BASKETBALL__ Embarassing!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Those Boston fans get pretty nasty when things don't go well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep. They've had a lot of success there, and they always expect maximum effort."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not to mention, there's always racists in the crowd there."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's sad. A great historical city, but a few bad apples can ruin a town's reputation in a hurry."
