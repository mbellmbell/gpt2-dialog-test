"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Old time Disney - it would be Sleeping Beauty. That was a groundbreaker in animation back in its day."
"__DISNEY__ What about a contemporary favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ It would have to be Aladdin. That film just had everything perfect."
"__DISNEY__ Kind of bittersweet now, since Robin Williams has passed."
"__DISNEY__ I'm grateful for films like Aladdin that captured Robin when he was at his peak, doing what he did better than anyone else in the world."
"__DISNEY__ He certainly made the Genie a unique and memorable character."
"__DISNEY__ He was so topical with his improv riffs that you need to look some of his references up to understand them! But that makes Aladdin a kind of time capsule as well as a great movie."
"__DISNEY__ It was fun to find out that Robin could sing, too. I guess he could do anything."
"__DISNEY__ He will live forever, thanks to Aladdin and all of his other wonderful work on film and TV. I'm glad for that."
