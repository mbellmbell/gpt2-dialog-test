"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the latest Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have no real interest in watching them to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just feel it's the same rehashed stuff all over again with minor nuances."
"__MOVIES__ Man, it's so good, you really have no idea."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ There's just twists and turns you wouldn't see coming."
"__MOVIES__ I would because I've read all about them."
"__MOVIES__ Whaaat why???"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I wanted to see what they were about and gauge my interest. Really it was just the episode 7 one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay so you haven't ruined all of them for yourself yet, haha!"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet but eventually I will."
"__MOVIES__ Well what types of movies are you into?"
"__MOVIES__ Lately I've been watching a lot of older movies rather than more recent ones."
"__MOVIES__ Very cool, like what?"
"__MOVIES__ I watched Kill Bill Vol. 2 for the first time, damn good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know man I just can't get into those Tarantino movies."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, we have totally different movie tastes, it seems."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe so, but we can watch each others' interests and broaden our horizons."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, more so your."
