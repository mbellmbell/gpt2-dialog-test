"__MOVIES__ We saw the remake of the Magnificent Seven on dvd recently."
"__MOVIES__ Cool.  You like westerns?"
"__MOVIES__ Some yeah."
"__MOVIES__ That's alright.  Who was in it."
"__MOVIES__ Some big name guys, Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt."
"__MOVIES__ I like them.  Wasn't there another movie with the same name?"
"__MOVIES__ Right.  From the sixties I think."
"__MOVIES__ Who was in that one."
"__MOVIES__ Let's see - Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen is who I remember."
"__MOVIES__ So you saw that one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah.  Its maybe the best, with famous music."
"__MOVIES__ I think I know that song."
"__MOVIES__ So the Yul Brynner/Denzel Washington character rounds up seven guys to protect a town."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a basic western."
"__MOVIES__ And Chris Pratt/ Steve McQueen provide a light touch."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that."
"__MOVIES__ But there's a lot of shooting and killing."
"__MOVIES__ What a surprise."
"__MOVIES__ And most of the seven die.  Its funny and sad."
"__MOVIES__ I'll try to see it sometime."
