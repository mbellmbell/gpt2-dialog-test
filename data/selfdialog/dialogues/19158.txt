"__MOVIES__ Do you want to watch Zootopia again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that sounds good. I love that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I think that it was really well done."
"__MOVIES__ I love all the characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they really did a good job pairing the voice to the character."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that originally the movie was supposed to revolve around Nick Wilde?"
"__MOVIES__ Instead of Judy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, but it didn't do well with test audiences."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I wonder what that version would have been like."
"__MOVIES__ I think if they had run with it anyway, it probably would have been a good niche film."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely would not have popularity that this one did."
"__MOVIES__ Still, it might have been interesting to see more of Nick's backstory."
"__MOVIES__ I know you love a good bad guy backstory."
"__MOVIES__ Hey, Nick wasn't all bad. He came around in the end."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, you're right."
"__MOVIES__ In fact, I bet kids that are bullied would have loved a version centered around him."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I could see that."
"__MOVIES__ We all knew no matter what, Judy was going to be ok, she had a family business to fall back on. But Nick, Nick had no one."
"__MOVIES__ He only had himself to rely on."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Now tell me that isn't a movie that you'd like to see!"
