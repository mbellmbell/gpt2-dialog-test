"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Doctor Strange yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No! Remind me which one that is again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a Marvel movie.  Starring Benedict Cumberbatch."
"__MOVIES__ Oh of course.  I have no seen that yet, but obviously I know of it."
"__MOVIES__ It's hard to keep track of all these Marvel movies, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, definitely.  I think the last one I watched was the last Captain America movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well Doctor Strange is on Netflix now.  Do you have Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I do!  That's great, I guess I will try to watch that over the weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, good idea.  It's a really good movie."
"__MOVIES__ So how do you like Cumberbatch in general as an actor?"
"__MOVIES__ I will be honest, I have not seen him in a lot of things.  I did enjoy that movie about Alan Turing."
"__MOVIES__ The Imitation Game, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one!  I really liked that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  I think he's starting to get some big roles now, so he's probably going to be a massive star."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  He did a really good job in The Imitation Game."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, definitely.  Portraying an actual historical figure is always tough to pull off."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think going forwards he's going to do more roles like Doctor Strange, like more blockbuster type movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I do not think it will diminish his career."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, you are right.  The big actors these days can do huge blockbuster movies and still be considered good actors as well."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  A guy like Matt Damon would be an example of that."
