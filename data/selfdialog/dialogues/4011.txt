"__MUSIC__ What kind of music is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Really, not too much appeals to me in our generation. I kind of like country I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Well then what kind of music from any generation appeals to you?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I like the 40's through the early 60's. It is pretty pure and innocent."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I do get tired of how raunchy everything is getting these days."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, that is why I like older music."
"__MUSIC__ Who is your favorite artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I really like a lot of different people, but I guess Frank Sinatra  best describes them."
"__MUSIC__ So you like crooner music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I guess you could say that. I like that style, but I also like big band without lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, I like big band too!"
"__MUSIC__ You don't find many people our age who like big band music."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh gosh, tough choice! I guess I would have to say In The Mood."
"__MUSIC__ That is a good one."
"__MUSIC__ What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I am not sure that it 100% qualifies as big band since it has lyrics, but I really like Chattanooga Choo-Choo."
"__MUSIC__ That is such a catchy song. I wish more people appreciated music like that these days."
"__MUSIC__ So do I. At least Michael Buble brings back some popularity to crooner type music."
"__MUSIC__ I do enjoy listening to Michael Buble's covers and original."
