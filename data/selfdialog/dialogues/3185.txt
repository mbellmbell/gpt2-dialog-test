"__MUSIC__ Mikey, how long has it been since you listened to a flawless album?"
"__MUSIC__ Good question, I'd say years in the least."
"__MUSIC__ I've been thinking how rare it is to listen to an album all the way through with only pure enjoyment."
"__MUSIC__ You are very right, and it is sad."
"__MUSIC__ I think the last flawless album I listened to was FutureSex/LoveSounds."
"__MUSIC__ A Justin Timberlake album, seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ That album is incredibly under rated, it ushered in a new era of pop and hip hop music."
"__MUSIC__ You may be kind of right, but not every song on that album was great."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say SexyBack was the weakest song musically, but every other song was literally amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't Timbaland produce Justin's works at that time?"
"__MUSIC__ For years they worked together, the true dynamic duo."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say that goes to Eminem and Dr. Dre."
"__MUSIC__ I can't argue with that, I was just in a pop music mood today."
"__MUSIC__ I can definitely appreciate Justin's voice and Timbo's beat making ability."
"__MUSIC__ Summer Love, My Love, What Goes Around..., all so different and astounding for the time."
"__MUSIC__ I remember we were in Spain when that album came out right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man, it just shows I haven't listened to a flawless album in over a decade."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're just stuck on the past."
"__MUSIC__ I am stuck on the past because the past was better."
"__MUSIC__ I actually get what you mean."
