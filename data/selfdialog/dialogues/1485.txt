"__MUSIC__ Are you excited for the new Arcade Fire album?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really know that much about them actually. What kind of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ They're an indie / alternative rock band. They've released some really great albums. I definitely recommend that you check them out."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I do like rock and roll music, so I'll have to give them a listen. What albums should I look for?"
"__MUSIC__ You could probably go in chronological order, but I'd say start with 'Funeral.' 'Reflektor' was really incredible too."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, thanks for the recommendation. As for me, I'm really stoked for the new Queens of the Stone Age album."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, I heard the first single from the album on the radio, it sounds great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's called 'The Way You Used To Do' I believe. That song is awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ There's some other cool new music coming up I'm pretty excited for, like the the new album by The National."
"__MUSIC__ I really like the lead singer's voice, really deep and emotive."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that band really knows how to conjure up a dark mood, but in a good way."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of dark, have you heard the latest album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds?"
"__MUSIC__ I did actually, really heartrending stuff."
"__MUSIC__ It sure was. No wonder after all he went through with the death of his son."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wondered whether he would return to making music at all, but I'm glad he did."
"__MUSIC__ I saw him perform not long ago on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert actually. It was good to see him on stage again."
"__MUSIC__ I imagine that must be very therapeutic for him in a way. I actually saw him perform at Madison Square Garden years ago in support of his album 'Dig Lazarus Dig.'"
"__MUSIC__ That must have been really cool. I hope to get a chance to catch his live act someday."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was a pretty wild night. You should see them if they're coming to a city near you."
"__MUSIC__ I'll make a point to do that. I wonder if the vibe will be different at his live shows now."
