"__STAR_WARS__ So did you see Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, no, let's not talk about that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ You didn't like it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was just so sad, everyone died at the end!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, yeah, but they completed their mission!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Lots of people complete their missions without dying!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, but they never showed up in the other films so they had to die."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess so, but couldn't just one of them had lived? Ride off into the sunset and never return?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, I think the sacrifice was more powerful this way. And Leia didn't die!"
"__STAR_WARS__ The tie in to the next movie was pretty cool, but I still think it was too sad."
