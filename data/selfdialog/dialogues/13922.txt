"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the destruction of the Celtics the other night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Unfortunately, I did. They need a whole new team to thwart LeBron!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, and it isn't just Lebron, either. Kevin Love and Kyrie are both top 15 players!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Irving may even be top five himself.He is amazing."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, James went 7 for 7 in the 1st quarter in Game 1. He looked like a man against boys!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, the Celtics are certainly overmatched.There is really nothing they can do!"
"__BASKETBALL__ They finally got lucky with the ping-pong balls in the draft."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is a relief! Who are they going to take? Lorenzo Ball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He is awesome, but I think they are leaning towards the kid from Washington."
"__BASKETBALL__ Felt. He is a 6' 4' guard. How can he help?"
"__BASKETBALL__ His arms are really long.Although a streaky shooter, he can ball!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Okay, will that put them in the conversation?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Against Cleveland?, ..no way! But he is a good piece. Crowder should be traded.I see his limitations."
"__BASKETBALL__ They ALL have limits. They are an excellent team already.It is just that James may be the Greatest of all Time. What can you do?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess we can reminisce. Larry Bird, DJ< McHale and Parish! Now, that was a team."
"__BASKETBALL__ They might not be able to beat this Cleveland team!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sorry, I have to disagree. The Celtics were 10 deep! This Cleveland team is not like that!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe you are right! It is an answer we will never have."
"__BASKETBALL__ Just enjoy the Celts for what they are. A team that can improve, too!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Gordon Hayward....would you come and play for the Celtics?"
