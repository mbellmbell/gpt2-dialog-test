"__STAR_WARS__ I just thought of something funny that could have happened in Episode VII."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was doing work, but okay. Let's hear it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Know how Kylo says 'Grandfather...I'll finish what you started.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, when looking at the helmet, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yup. Imagine if he was from a different region."
"__STAR_WARS__ How would that matter?"
"__STAR_WARS__ 'Dad-dad. Papa. Gramps. I'll finish what you started.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ So?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Same meaning, but hilarious"
"__STAR_WARS__ I get it, but the tone would be too affected. It would be distracting."
