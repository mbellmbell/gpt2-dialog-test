"__MUSIC__ Do you enjoy listening to Eminem these days?"
"__MUSIC__ I do actually."
"__MUSIC__ Why though?"
"__MUSIC__ Well as he's matured so have I."
"__MUSIC__ His music used to be a bit childish didn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes but that's what my teenage self needed something to connect with."
"__MUSIC__ He did do that quite well."
"__MUSIC__ It feels like as he's matured so have I and it feels great to have a rapper I can connect with my whole life."
"__MUSIC__ At least up to this point."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah good point."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just happy he's still making music after all these years, so many stop or take long breaks but he really hasn't."
"__MUSIC__ He's had a break or two here and there but it wasn't for long stretches and he always comes back."
"__MUSIC__ Can you imagine 80 year old Eminem still rapping?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be awesome."
"__MUSIC__ He would be rapping about his cane and them kids on his lawn."
"__MUSIC__ I can picture it now."
"__MUSIC__ I'm so glad he exists though, rap would be dull without him."
"__MUSIC__ He carried the music genre through the years, just not sure who is going to take the torch."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if anyone can step up at this point."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so either sadly."
