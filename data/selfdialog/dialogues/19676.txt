"__MOVIES__ Did you go see that new movie with king Arthur?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean King Arthur?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one, did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did. You have not?"
"__MOVIES__ No, was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was full of action. I liked it, are you going to see it ?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, it looks a lot like Tristan and Isolde to me."
"__MOVIES__ It is actually a similar story structure. But it is worth seeing, reminds me more of the old film Camelot."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that show! Same feel as Robin Hood, with Kevin Costner."
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, with his accent. No, the best Robin Hood, was Robin Hood Men in Tights, ever seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! classic, funny, gold. A lot like The Princess Brid."
"__MOVIES__ The best movie ever made. Based on a book, like Breakfast at Tiffany's believe it or not."
"__MOVIES__ I did not know that, is Breakfast at Tiffany's as good as people say?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I mean it is no Roman Holiday, but it is cute and funny and warming."
"__MOVIES__ I love all her work, did you ever see her in My Fair Lady?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, liked that show a lot. Her name reminds me of Dr. Doolittle."
"__MOVIES__ I liked those shows. Did you see the newer Dr.Doolittles?"
"__MOVIES__ With Eddie Murphy? of course, they were funny, reminded me of Flubber."
"__MOVIES__ Flubber, classic lost to the times. Ever see Jumanji?"
"__MOVIES__ Scared me, so I did not finish it."
