"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eagles, Broncos, Chiefs, Seahawks, Raiders, Cardinals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about them? Why are you just rattling off teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ These are the teams that the Giants have to actually work at beating this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right and we play Philly twice this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eagles will win both games, but I think all the others are going to be close."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think is going to be the deciding factor?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Offensive line. They need to show up to the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. They did nothing to improve the situation this summer either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We spent a lot of time concentrating on defense and I'm not sure it was the right move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the league is filled with offense heavy teams this year, so maybe it was the right thing to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the league is also heavy with big defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok. So what do we need to get around Seattle. They're the real threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Prayer and maybe some wizardry. They are going to eat our O-line alive"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope Eli worked on his agility drills this summer because he's going to be doing a lot of running that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt we will see any more movement from Eli, he's not getting any younger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe his age will impart some wisdom that will help them will a win against them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They passed on a lot of O-line talent in the draft, maybe he should have imparted some of that wisdom on Jerry Reese."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's made a lot of questionable decisions lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he's been one of the best at assembling talent since he almost got fired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Questionably the best."
