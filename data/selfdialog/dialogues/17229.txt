"__MOVIES__ I swear I could watch 'Interview with a Vampire' everyday. I love that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't care for Brad Pitt in that movie at all."
"__MOVIES__ Why not? I think he done a great job in his role as Louie."
"__MOVIES__ I really wasn't crazy about Tom Cruise as Lestat either."
"__MOVIES__ I agree there, Tom did ok, but I think Stuart Townsend did a better job as Lestat in Queen of the Damned."
"__MOVIES__ Definately. I feel he had more charisma on screen in that role than Cruise did."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder, characterwise, if Lestat missed Louie and in that found a shred of humanity , thus his need to be famous."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was more to spite Marius."
"__MOVIES__ I think the scene where they wall Louie up is a homage to Poe."
"__MOVIES__ How is that a homage to Poe?"
"__MOVIES__ It is a scene from the short story  'Cask of the Amandillado'"
"__MOVIES__ I never thought of that, but could be for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Louie just seemed too whiny, and Pitt always looked so mournful, like there was no celebration in him at all."
"__MOVIES__ That is why Lestat got him that lil girl, that and he had lost his wife and baby in child birth, he mourned his family. Lestat made him a new one."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you think for the little girl?"
"__MOVIES__ I think she played her character very well. She embodied Lestat better than cruise did."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they hadn't killed her off."
"__MOVIES__ yeah it would have been more twisted if she had come back as the chic from the Illuminate"
"__MOVIES__ yeah that would have been awesome, but I think Pitt done an ok job."
"__MOVIES__ I prefer him in other roles. I just don't think he would have been my first choice for Louie."
