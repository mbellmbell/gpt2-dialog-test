"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, there are a few teams that just seem to be bordering falling off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Seattle may be one and Green Bay may be another."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree, but Denver has to be at the top of the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, what are they doing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it seems like they have spent a lot of money on their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nothing on their offense though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they literally have very few playmakers there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, who follows up a superbowl with a 7th round rookie QB?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I do not know how they thought that could have worked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could have been a distaster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they are lucky he turned out okay, but still not good enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it was too bad that they couldn't build on that success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, when you go from a hall of fame quarterback to a scrub, stuff like that tends to happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. The defense just couldn't carry them enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the defense can only do so much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they were living proof of that this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure were and it didn't work out to well for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, maybe this year will be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not know. They still don't have a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. It might take a couple years."
