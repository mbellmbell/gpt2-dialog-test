"__HORROR__ I heard that they're finally making another Jeepers Creepers movie."
"__HORROR__ They are? That's news to me."
"__HORROR__ It's called Jeepers Creepers;: Cathedral. Filming is already underway."
"__HORROR__ I bet it'll be out by Halloween. Who's in it?"
"__HORROR__ Meg Foster, Stan Shaw, and, I think, Michael Papajohn."
"__HORROR__ Johnathan Breck still playing as The Creeper?"
"__HORROR__ Defiantly. I can't wait to see it."
"__HORROR__ Same here. It takes place after the last movie right?"
"__HORROR__ Actually, no.  From what I read Creepers 3 takes place between the first and second movie."
"__HORROR__ That's disappointing. I really wanted to see what happens to the old guy and his son at the end of the third movie."
