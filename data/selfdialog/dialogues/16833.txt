"__MOVIES__ Hey what is your opinion on the surge of feminist movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure my feelings are not the norm."
"__MOVIES__ Well what do you feel about them?"
"__MOVIES__ I hate them to be honest with you."
"__MOVIES__ How come? What's wrong with a littl bit of girl power?"
"__MOVIES__ Nothing actually, but unfortunately it's a lot of girl power and man bashing."
"__MOVIES__ What film have you seen that bashes men?"
"__MOVIES__ The new Ghost Busters films bashes men left and right,"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Every guy in the film is portrayed as a complete incompetent, it's actually pretty insulting."
"__MOVIES__ Alright aside from Ghost Busters what other movies have you seen that deliberately bash men?"
"__MOVIES__ How about that movie by Tyler Perry? It was called 'For Colored Girls'."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of it, I'm not a fan of him or his movies in all honesty."
"__MOVIES__ Well this movie specifically paints men out to be a bunch of wife beating rapists."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What is the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ The plot is a group of women ovrcome their hardships that are ironically caused by the men in their lives."
"__MOVIES__ That's it?"
