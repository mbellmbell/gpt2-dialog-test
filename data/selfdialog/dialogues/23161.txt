"__DISNEY__ I have this theory that kids in America are really defined by which Disney movies come out when they're young enough to like them."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, like, The Lion King came out when I was five, and that was when I liked Disney the most. So I think of it as my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ Hmm. I like One Hundred and One Dalmatians though, but it came out way before I was a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, but what came out when you were five."
"__DISNEY__ Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. Do you like Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ I love it!"
"__DISNEY__ See what I mean?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess you might be right."
