"__MUSIC__ Yes that's correct D, C,F, E is what you get transpose Bb, G#, C#,  C."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I am good at this."
"__MUSIC__ Well now consider the last rule."
"__MUSIC__ Um... what was the last rule?"
"__MUSIC__ Begin the row with any note you want except without repeating the notes. Well, that's more like rule 1 AND 4, but anyway"
"__MUSIC__ oh yeah..."
"__MUSIC__ Consider the following notes.  D, C,F, E, Bb, G#, C#,  C."
"__MUSIC__ Um, those are the same notes we did before."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Now you're gonna treat them as a row."
"__MUSIC__ So the row is now D, C, F, E, Bb, G#, C#, C?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. What's wrong here?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh... C is repeating."
"__MUSIC__ Precisely. How can you fix this?"
"__MUSIC__ We constructed this initially by tranposing the retrograde by a 3rd."
"__MUSIC__ What happend is if transpose it by a 4th?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's see. I should've gotten Eb, C#, F#, F?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. And if you were to use that in your row, can you?"
"__MUSIC__ No."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Eb, C#, F#, F, Bb, G#, C#, C now gives me repeating C#."
