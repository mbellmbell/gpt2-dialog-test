"__STAR_WARS__ So what color lightsaber is the best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to go with green"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because it was the new one unveiled by Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, but didn't they have green ones in the prequels"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but that was after Return of the Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought they were supposed to take place before"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they came out after the original three"
"__STAR_WARS__ But they were prequels"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think they should be part of the storyline they were so bad."
