"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars movies villain is your favorite of all time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is Darth Vader. And yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would have to agree. His story line is just so tragic and captivating."
"__STAR_WARS__ How do you feel about Kylo Ren in comparison to Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think Kylo Ren can compare. Darth Vader just seemed much more powerful."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. Kylo Ren is more of a wannabe dark Lord, but acts more like a rebel child."
"__STAR_WARS__ I was surprised that the child of Han and Leia turned out dark in the first place though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, me too. You would think that he would be surrounded by some very good influences."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess anyone exposed to the force is vulnerable to both sides of the force though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes it can definitely go both ways, and the balance is hard to keep."
