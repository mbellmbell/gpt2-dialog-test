"__DISNEY__ You know, ever since Disney took over Star Wars, they've been doing a lot with it."
"__DISNEY__ Star Wars is a popular series. People remember it from when they were kids and they're kind of banking on that to draw people in."

"__DISNEY__ I mean, look at the newer stuff with Rey and all. They kind of redid the old stuff by having history repeat itself."
"__DISNEY__ I see what you mean, but it's still kind of about how people can work together to make good things happen if they believe."
"__DISNEY__ Well, yeah, that and the thing with Kylo Ren and Darth Vader and Han Solo."
"__DISNEY__ I miss Carrie Fisher."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, she was amazing. I miss her, too."
"__DISNEY__ Gotta love Princess Leia."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, gotta love Princess Leia."
