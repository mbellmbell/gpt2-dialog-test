"__FASHION__ So what styles attract you the most?"
"__FASHION__ Well, let's see, I really like to dress in modern styles that have lots of colour. What about you?"
"__FASHION__ Well I would have to say formal wear is my favorite. I just like to look posh."
"__FASHION__ Is that because you aren't posh?"

"__FASHION__ That is true, but where did you get your shoes?"
"__FASHION__ Well I got them at pay-less actually, they where a steal."
"__FASHION__ And they are so cute on you. I wish I had shoes like that."
