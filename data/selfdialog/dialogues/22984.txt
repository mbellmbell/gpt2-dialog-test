"__DISNEY__ What do you think of the Happiest Millonaire?"
"__DISNEY__ I actually kind of like it."
"__DISNEY__ I don't. I think it is one of the lesser Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ I like it better than Summer Magic."
"__DISNEY__ Well, that one was a total waste of talent."
"__DISNEY__ At least the Happiest Millionaire had Fred McMurrary and Greer Garson."
"__DISNEY__ I do like Lesley Ann Warren in that."
"__DISNEY__ Eh. I'm not too crazy about her.  I like Haley Mills better."
"__DISNEY__ But, the songs are kind of cute in Happiest Millionaire."
"__DISNEY__ I agree."
