"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like the Patriots and Seahawks could meet in the superbowl if everyone stays healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree, but I would bet more on the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I think you might be wrong about that one. The Patriots are still at their peak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I mean, you are right, but Seattle is too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Seattle just has been in the news for more bad things lately. Like Richard Sherman's antics."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he has a to just chill. He is smart, but needs to tone it down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but he hasn't to this point and I doubt he ever will."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but he is still a great player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well both teams should have good years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I'm not sure if anyone can challenge the patriots in the AFC either honestly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I feel like there are more good teams in the NFC this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does feel that way. More competition too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe some teams will step up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, like Tennessee and Miami. Its about time they both show up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they both have good young quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but one may not actually be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure about Tannehill. Maybe this is the year he really shows what he can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so! He has a lot of receivers around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we know what Mariota can do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we found that out at times last year. I want to see more!"
