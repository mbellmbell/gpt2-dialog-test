"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! Are you ready for football to start up again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait... espcially because I playing in a few fantasy football leauges this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love fantasy football but I never seem to do very well in it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's part luck and part knowing who the elite players are."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It makes sense that the more knowledgable one is the better they will do"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if we're not in the same leauge I will help you make some choices as to what players to draft if you'd like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would probably be very helpful as I tend to always pick my favorite players but not necesarily the best players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I follow a lot of teams pretty closely and always pick players based on their abilities... not whether I like them or not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of players... who is your favorite player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine is Drew Brees... what about yourself?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a big fan of Carson Wentz. I am excitied for what he can do for the Philadelphia Eagles this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's an exciting player that could have a long career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I just don't think we will ever see someone as elite as Tom Brady has been ever again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't stand him because he is so skilled and I'm sick of him being so good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's definitely overstayed his welcome. He should retire while he is a champion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but I also wouldn't be surprised for them to have a chance at winning it all again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really just don't want the Patriots or the Cowboys to have any success this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's going to be a bounce back year for a lot of teams that didn't fair to well last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. I'd like to see new teams emerge as contenders... that's always exciting to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll wait and see... I just can't wait for football to be back!"
