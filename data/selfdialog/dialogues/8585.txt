"__BEATLES__ Musically speaking, who do you think the most talented Beatle was?"
"__BEATLES__ Wow, that's a hard choice. Every member of the Beatles was incredibly gifted."
"__BEATLES__ True, though I've always had a soft spot for John Lennon. His songwriting skills were unparalleled."
"__BEATLES__ That's true, but didn't he write most of them with Paul McCartney?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, he did while he was with the Beatles. His solo stuff is just as good though, and Paul obviously wasn't around for that."
"__BEATLES__ I see your point. 'Imagine' really is an amazing song."
"__BEATLES__ I think my second favorite in terms of musical talent is George Harrison."
"__BEATLES__ Really? Most people seem to go for John or Paul."
"__BEATLES__ Well, George wrote and sang 'Here Comes the Sun', 'Something', and 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. Those are three of the Beatles greatest songs."
"__BEATLES__ He did all three of those? Wow, he really doesn't get as much credit as he deserves, does he?"
