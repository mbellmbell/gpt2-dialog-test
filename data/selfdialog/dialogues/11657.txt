"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't count out Green Bay just yet either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, just when you think they are done, they start winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year at one point, they looked awful. Then look."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they made a nice run to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you know this is a quarterback driven league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. With a top 3 quarterback, you can always be in contention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely agree, but you also need playmakers and I'm just not sure Rodgers has that anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he has some guys to throw to, but I'm not sure if they can stop anybody."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I can't even name anyone on that defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, neither can opposing offenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, its been that way for New Orleans now for years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brees throws for 500 yards and 4 touchdowns and still loses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it has been. They have made very little effort to improve that defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it is a shame because Brees isn't getting any younger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they did add Adrian Peterson, but it seems like he is washed up anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he might just be a goal line back there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he might try to win a starting job. It looks like thats not really available there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but you really never know with injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, its amazing how short of a career running backs have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well they take a lot of hits thats for sure."
