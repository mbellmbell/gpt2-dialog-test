"__MUSIC__ Did you like George Michael more when he was in Wham! or when he was a solo artist?"
"__MUSIC__ If forced to decide, I would lean slightly towards Wham!, but he was a great solo artist."
"__MUSIC__ Totally agree, Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go is one of my favorite 80s songs."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I would have pegged you more as a Careless Whisper kind of guy."
"__MUSIC__ In terms of his slower songs, I much prefer Father Figure."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they're both very similar. The 80s had tons of ballads in those styles."
"__MUSIC__ That's my favorite type of 80s music, especially those ballad type pop songs that were associated with movies."
"__MUSIC__ You mean like Hungry Eyes from Dirty Dancing or Man in Motion from St. Elmo's Fire?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, I love that synth heavy style."
"__MUSIC__ What about new wave? That was also synth heavy."
"__MUSIC__ I also enjoyed that. However, I found many of those groups like Duran Duran overrated."
"__MUSIC__ Really? They define the 80s for me. You know they were the first group to incorporate models into their music videos?"
"__MUSIC__ All I know is that their songs Rio and Hungry Like the Wolf sound very similar."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but they were both great songs so I can look past that."
"__MUSIC__ Fair, but I preferred other new wave groups to Duran Duran, such as Culture Club and ABC."
"__MUSIC__ I am not familiar with ABC, who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They were an English band that had hits like Poison Arrow and The Look of Love."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check them out. I love obscure 80s groups."
"__MUSIC__ Well speaking of obscure 80s music, are you familiar with the group Modern English?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! I Melt with You is a classic 1980s song."
