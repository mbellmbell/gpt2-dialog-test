"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see the Chiefs hired a new GM?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I haven't been paying much attention this off season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess they let the last one go and it doesn't sound like it ended well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm, I wonder what could have happened, but I'm sure we'll never know everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The new GM sounds like he's been a coach or part of the team before, so hopefully that'll help."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so! The Chiefs could really use some good luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it's been years since they've even come close to making it to the Super Bowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's been really hard to be a fan all these years, but yet we still show up every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and the ticket prices keep going up!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, my siblings have season tickets in the lower level and they're $850 for ten games! Don't even get me started on parking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The parking is highway robbery!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I saw that it can get up to $60 per car if you don't pre-pay!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, that would be a nightmare! I'd never pay that to let my car sit in a parking lot!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither would I. I think I'm going to sit the season out and cheer on from home."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like it'll be easier. Maybe I can join you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely! Let's start our own Chiefs Sunday tradition!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe if we don't go, they'll do better. It wouldn't hurt to try!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so. I haven't seen a Super Bowl with the Chiefs in my lifetime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My parents had barely seen it either! Here's to hoping!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's go Chiefs!"
