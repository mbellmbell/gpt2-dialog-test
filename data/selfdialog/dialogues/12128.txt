"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think of last year's Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was disappointed, I really thought the Falcons had it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, they did have a 28-3 lead after the first half."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady really brought the Patriots back though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but not until the 4th quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really proved his greatness!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, I think he's fading.  He missed a lot of opportunities in the first half."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And it was such a long game, 4 and a half hours!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't believe it when the Patriots made that 2-point conversion! Yeah, and with only 6 minutes left!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still thought the Falcons had it in the bag..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially after Jones caught that 27 yard pass that put Atlanta on the Patriots 22 yard line!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, a field goal and the game would have been over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Things really turned when Ryan got sacked!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And that holding call on Jake Matthews - I was losing hope fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, going from being on the 22 yard line with a chance to clinch it, to having to punt was a real let down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was so tense, I coultn't stand it!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then Edelman catches the ball on the 50 yard line!  1:28 was plenty of time for Brady to at least tie the game..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which he did! And then the Patriots won the coin toss....."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, then the Patriots march right on down the field and win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It wouldâ€™ve been great to see if Atlanta could have regrouped and won.   Maybe this year....."
