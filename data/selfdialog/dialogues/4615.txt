"__MUSIC__ Precisely. Do you unbderstand somewhat now?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. Go back to that example you gave"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, so you have C, C#, G# triad, right? And let say you want the retrograde"
"__MUSIC__ Backwards. so... G#, C# C."
"__MUSIC__ Now if you were to invert that G# it is allowed. But if you were to transpose that G# into C or C# that's not allowed."
"__MUSIC__ Oh.... i get it now."
"__MUSIC__ Now imagine doing this with the entire row of notes."
"__MUSIC__ it's mind boggling."
"__MUSIC__ It really is. And it's not easy because you're tryign to discover musical form out of these rules."
"__MUSIC__ That's why so many of these have simiular feelings to them."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. because they follow the same rules, or at least in part."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, so there are other who do not follow these 4 rules?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Hauer system they don't have the rule 3."
"__MUSIC__ Weird."
"__MUSIC__ So let's say you have C, C#, G#, and Bb. And If I were to retrograde that i would get what?"
"__MUSIC__ Bb, G#, C#, C"
"__MUSIC__ Good. And if I were to transpose it by a 3rd, what do I get?"
"__MUSIC__ Um... Bb raised by a third is what?"
"__MUSIC__ Bb is 1, B is 1#, C is 2, C# is 2# and 3 is D.  Then the original Bb, G#, C#, C is what?"
"__MUSIC__ So it will be D, C, F, E?"
