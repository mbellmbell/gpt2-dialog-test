"__HORROR__ Have you seen Get Out?"
"__HORROR__ Yea, that was creepy!"
"__HORROR__ I thought it was good. It didn't really scare me though."
"__HORROR__ Even at the end?"
"__HORROR__ Yea, I saw the ending coming, you could tell his girlfriend was in on it the whole time."
"__HORROR__ Not me, I was shocked."
"__HORROR__ It took me a while to figure out what exactly was happening though."
"__HORROR__ Yea me too, I couldn't figure out why the staff at the house was acting so weird towards the main character."
"__HORROR__ Yea, but it all made sense in the end."
"__HORROR__ Well, kind of. It was pretty crazy."
