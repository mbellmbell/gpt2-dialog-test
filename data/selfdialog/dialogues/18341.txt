"__MOVIES__ What role would you recast?"
"__MOVIES__ Katniss Everdeen in Hunger Game Series."
"__MOVIES__ You don't like Jennifer Lawrence?"
"__MOVIES__ I love her, just felt she was wrong for the role."
"__MOVIES__ How so? Isn't katniss kind of stoic?"
"__MOVIES__ I am more bothered by how far from the book version she seems."
"__MOVIES__ What is so different to you? I don't get it."
"__MOVIES__ Well Susan Collins wrote that Katniss was almost emaciated. Super skinny,"
"__MOVIES__ Jennifer is not fat by any means!"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all, but she is not malnourished. Especially before losing a little weight."
"__MOVIES__ She does seem to have slimmed down the longer she is in Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ Overall just felt she was not true depiction of the character,I would have cast some waif actress."
"__MOVIES__ Who could have been strong enough though, acting wise?"
"__MOVIES__ Isabelle Fuhrman maybe would have pulled it off more for me."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't she cast as Clove in the film?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I would have switch the two actors roles."
"__MOVIES__ I think Jen was to biga star to take that role."
"__MOVIES__ Probably true but Isabelle Fuhrman is a strong actress."
"__MOVIES__ I think she was in the running for Katniss at one point."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. If you saw her in Orphan, she proves she has some acting chops."
