"__MOVIES__ What are your thoughts on the new Mummy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm really not sure. I like it but I don't at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree with you."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that there is supposed to be a bunch of monster movies after this."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's what I heard to."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know what monsters are supposed to be in the future movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I heard that Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is supposed to possibly be."
"__MOVIES__ I think that is a terrible idea."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I agree with you man. Have you heard of any?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I wonder if Wolfman is going to be as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's a really good guess, actually. I'm not sure either."
"__MOVIES__ Have you got a chance to see the new movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ I only got to see about the first 20 minutes before I got a call to going to work."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that really stinks. How did you least like the first 20 minutes?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was actually really good to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Was the acting done well?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is done very well, but you know how much I like Tom Cruise."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that is very true. I think he's a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the woman who played the mummy did a great job as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she is a great actress. I really loved her in Kingsman."
