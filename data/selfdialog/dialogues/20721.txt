"__THRILLER__ Have I mentioned that 'The Prestige' is my favorite movie?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I never knew that you loved that film so much."
"__THRILLER__ Well I've seen it over twenty times."
"__THRILLER__ What makes you love it so much?"
"__THRILLER__ It's got tons of great actors in it, and the mood and tone of the movie is so eery."
"__THRILLER__ It does kind of have a spooky atmosphere."
"__THRILLER__ I love most Christopher Nolan films for that reason, and the music is haunting too."
"__THRILLER__ Now you're making me want to watch it again."
"__THRILLER__ I'm probably going to have to watch it again tonight when I get home."
"__THRILLER__ Well I'll most likely wait longer than that, but I definitely want to view it again to see if I missed anything the first time around."
