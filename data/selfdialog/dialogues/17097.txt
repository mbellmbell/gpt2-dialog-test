"__MOVIES__ Man, i'm excited about the new Wonder Woman movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too! I thought the introduction during Batman VS Superman was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think they try to gradually put in their characters into their films to segway that character into its own movie."
"__MOVIES__ You mean Marvel? Yeah, like they even combine Iron Man and Spiderman into Spiderman's upcoming movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah kinda like Iron Man and Captain America too."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, so far I've watched all three of them."
"__MOVIES__ You mean Captain America series? Yep me too"
"__MOVIES__ Wonder what the next, I mean the fourth one will be."
"__MOVIES__ Man there are so many other Marvel stuff too..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you're right...Aquaman and Flash for instance."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely Flash. I've watched the original TV series many years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Yep he was also in the latest Marvel movie too for just a couple minutes."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah the one where Bruce Wayne tried to throw something at him and The Flash avoided it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I thought that was cool."
"__MOVIES__ I'd say many things are possible now because of the technology like CGI."
"__MOVIES__ Yep otherwise we won't be able to see all the Superhero fights and all."
"__MOVIES__ I almost forgot..another thing is Justice League, that's going to be great also"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it would be great to see all the superheroes in one movie like the Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ Except it's a DC Comics not Marvel."
"__MOVIES__ True, although it's still very cool in my opinion."
