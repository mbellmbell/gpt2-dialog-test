"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was listening to the radio today.  They had a list of the best coaches for the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The football team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they had a list of the top five."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm sure Sean Peyton was at the top of the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was guessing the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean you didn't listen?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I got out the car before they mentioned a single name."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow.  I would have stayed in the car to hear that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they said it would be online.  And they kind of alluded that Payton would be topping the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder who the other coaches were."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The first name that came to my mind was Mike Ditka."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I was thinking him and Jim Mora."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if that might have been because they coached when we were growing up though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It could be, but they both did pretty decently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but only Payton went all the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who else did Ditka coach?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm pretty sure it was Chicago you are thinking of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's it.  It was the bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think most of the other coaches coached other teams too."
