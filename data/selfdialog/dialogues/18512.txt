"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch the movie Criminal?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so. Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Kevin Costner and Ryan Reynolds."
"__MOVIES__ Well that's a weird combination in a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Well Reynolds sort of gets killed in the beginning."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks for ruining that for me."
"__MOVIES__ It won't ruin it. You still see him, and you don't know the story line."
"__MOVIES__ Is Costner a policeman?"
"__MOVIES__ No. He's actually the criminal."
"__MOVIES__ That's odd. He is usually the good guy in movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he is. He does have his moments in this one though."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a good action movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Good story line to it."
"__MOVIES__ Any other good actors?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I'm not good remembering names."
"__MOVIES__ Was it a long movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I don't know. Keeps your attention though."
"__MOVIES__ So I should watch it? Did you rent it?"
"__MOVIES__ We watched it either on HBO or Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. I'll look for it."
