"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to Harry Styles' new songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I saw him perform on Saturday Night Live and looked up a few YouTube videos."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of them?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't care for them at first."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That is surprising."
"__MUSIC__ They remind me of John Lennon."
"__MUSIC__ And how is that a bad thing?"
"__MUSIC__ It felt inauthentic at first, like he was relying on other artists' methods for success."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I can understand why you feel that way."
"__MUSIC__ The songs have grown on me though."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, I knew you would come around!"
"__MUSIC__ The songs are a great fit for his voice."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he sounds a lot more mature."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, much more so than all the other One Direction solo efforts."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like any other of the groups' solo music?"
"__MUSIC__ Zayn's stuff has been great, very fitting."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I expected him to go the R&B, hip-hop route."
"__MUSIC__ It suits his personality much more than One Direction's cheesy pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Zayn's stuff are my favorite of all the other band members."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but Harry's is coming in a close second."
