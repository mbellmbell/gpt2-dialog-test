"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Ben Stiller movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a good question. It has to be either be Zoolander or Meet the Parents."
"__MOVIES__ Zoolander is one of my all time favorite comedies. Who is your favorite character from that film?"
"__MOVIES__ This may sound weird, but the hand model played by David Duchovny."
"__MOVIES__ He was funny. I really liked Owen Wilson's character, Hansel McDonald."
"__MOVIES__ He was great too. What recent movies has Owen Wilson been in?"
"__MOVIES__ Aside from Zoolander 2, he just voiced Lightning McQueen in the most recent Cars movie."
"__MOVIES__ Totally forgot that he's in that movie. I think that's because I just associate him with Wedding Crashers."
"__MOVIES__ Another great movie. Do you think that they will ever make a sequal?"
"__MOVIES__ A sequel is reportedly in the works. I really enjoyed Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn's last movie together, The Internship."
"__MOVIES__ Really? It was just a giant infomercial for Google."
"__MOVIES__ That was sort of annoying, but I thought Vince Vaughn was very funny in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Vince Vaughn has been on a cold streak recently when it comes to movies."
"__MOVIES__ He gets a bad reputation. While the movies don't perform well at the box office, they're generally pretty fun to watch."
"__MOVIES__ I saw Unfinished Business on a plane last year and found it very boring."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that movie. I think that he's been going more in a serious direction recently with films like Hacksaw Ridge."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot that he was in that. That was a great film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Mel Gibson is such a talented director."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. Bravehart is also one of my favorite movies of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I think that his best work as a director was in Apocalypto."
