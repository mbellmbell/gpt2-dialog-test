"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was a pretty good movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ It definitely filled in a lot of information that was intregal to the original movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought the action scenes were pretty good and very classic."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought the heroine was a lot like Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Star Wars really likes having a strong female character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but they do kind of seem alike, don't they?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I still thought it was neat that they CGIed Leia into the movie, despite her passing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they will do that in the future? how will they explain her death in Episode 8?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, but Han is gone too, now. I wonder if they still would have killed him off if they had known."
