"__DISNEY__ I always loved to watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs when I was little."
"__DISNEY__ That was one of my favorites, too! I loved all the cute animals."
"__DISNEY__ The dwarfs were pretty cute, too."
"__DISNEY__ Dopey is definitely the cutest."
"__DISNEY__ I liked Dopey, but Bashful has always been my favorite."
"__DISNEY__ The way Bashful blushes is very adorable! Even Grumpy is cute."
"__DISNEY__ For someone named Grumpy, he's not that bad after all!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad the Evil Queen lost in the end, and I was very glad she didn't hurt the dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I would have actually been more upset if something happened to the dwarfs than Snow White."
"__DISNEY__ Snow White was a nice person, though. At least she ended up safe!"
