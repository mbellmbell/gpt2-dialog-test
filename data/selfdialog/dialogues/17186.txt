"__MOVIES__ So what time are me going to the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's go around 8 or 9. Hey what do you think about the dinner and a movie combo?"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a wonderful treat!"
"__MOVIES__ I want to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2!"
"__MOVIES__ The first one was so hilarious. Love me some Groot!"
"__MOVIES__ The sound track was perfect for that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait to see baby Groot! i hope it is as good as the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Who knows sometimes they can hit a home run twice with a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ What other sequels did you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Beverly Hills Cop for sure. Eddy Murphy's character is so perfectly annoying."
"__MOVIES__ Also what are the cop movies with Danny Glover and Mel Gibson?"
"__MOVIES__ Lethal Weapon! Very dramatic but with just the right amount of humor tossed in to make it interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I liked them okay I suppose. But if I had to go for a cop sequel it would have to be with Bruce Willis."
"__MOVIES__ Ahh Yes Die Hard. Good one."
"__MOVIES__ Die Hard movies are so over the top in intensity."
"__MOVIES__ You are quite right about that."
"__MOVIES__ I like the Christmas one the best."
"__MOVIES__ Oh speaking of sequels and Christmas how about National Lampoon sequels."
"__MOVIES__ Randy Quaid is SOOOOOO annoying in these movies. he drives me crazy to watch him."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he is a goofy dude and plays the part too well!"
