"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, Lando really found a cool job as a city manager there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and he had that one bald assistant that had those head phones."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah I remember him. Whatever happened to him?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think they showed anything in movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I imagine he was shot be a stormtrooper at some point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah, those stormtroopers could never hit anyone with their blasters."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha! That's true."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe it was Bobba Fett."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he seemed to have better aim and intelligence."
