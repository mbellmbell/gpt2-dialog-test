"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite NFL team these days?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have two - one AFC and one NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is funny - I am kind of the same way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh which ones are your favorites."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well AFC - the Denver Broncos are my favorite and my most favorite overall."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like watching them too, Seems like they are usually good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And my favorite NFC team is the Washington Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats my number one team - lifelong Redskins fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I live near DC so I see alot of games and hear alot about them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up there, but live up near Boston now - so I am a Patriots fan too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is funny - we are similar I think, I spent alot of time in the Denver area - loved the Broncos"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And we both like the teams where we live also.  I'd love to see them both in the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel the same - if the Broncos and Redskins were in the Super Bowl - I think I would try to get tickets and go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the weak side of that is thee Redskins though - they are not ready for Prime Time yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree they definitely are not super bowl bound. How about the Patriots? You think they can repeat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Brady and Bellichek - they seem to always have a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah great pair for sure! I think they are the concensus favorites to make it too the SuperBowl this coming season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah they should be better with the trades they made and Gronkowski back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know its amazing they won the SuperBowl without him last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he gone the whole playoff run.  Last year was definitely all Brady all the time."
