"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite David Lynch film?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say Blue Velvet."
"__MOVIES__ Really, why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ It has so many of the typical Lynch-isms but is also just accessible enough for anyone to enjoy."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by Lynch-isms?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it contains the wholesome American suburbs juxtaposed with some of the worst horrors imaginable."
"__MOVIES__ Dennis Hopper really did play an evil villain."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, his performance was quite haunting."
"__MOVIES__ Ebert criticized the treatment of Isabella Rosellini during the film, but later recanted these concerns."
"__MOVIES__ I think he must have misread the film. Those scenes seemed necessary just to underscore how truly evil Hopper's character was."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, those scenes were necessary. What did you think of Kyle Maclachlan's performance?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought he was great. He does a good job playing clean-cut all-American types of characters."
"__MOVIES__ That is similar to his character on Twin Peaks."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, he is very believable in those kinds of roles."
"__MOVIES__ Laura Dern is also very good."
"__MOVIES__ She is always good, and she is so young in this film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is strange to see the young versions of these actors, but it provides them, especially Dern and Maclachlan with an air of innocence."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is very strange."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the ending?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it is one of the best Lynch endings. It is clear that good wins out in this case."
