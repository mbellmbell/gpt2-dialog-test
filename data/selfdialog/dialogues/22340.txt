"__DISNEY__ Fantasia is the weirdest Disney movie ever."
"__DISNEY__ That's the one where Mickey Mouse is a wizard right."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's got that iconic scene where he's trying to use magic to clean his castle."
"__DISNEY__ And then all the brooms go crazy and start doing a weird army march."
"__DISNEY__ And the castle ends up flooding because he uses too much magic or something like that."
"__DISNEY__ It's got a really fantastic musical score as well, but I agree it's totally weird."
"__DISNEY__ Doesn't Mickey Mouse's dog, Pluto, make a totally out of place cameo appearance."
"__DISNEY__ I think so but I can't remember too much about it."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha me neither but I always used to listen to the soundtrack to fall asleep."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha that's almost as weird as the film itself."
