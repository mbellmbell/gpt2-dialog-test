"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I cannot wait until the start of the NFL season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, our Packers are going to dominate, I can feel it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right on, we're going for it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aaron Rodgers MVP, he is going to come in with a vengeance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, all that criticism last year, he has something to prove and it will be great for our team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we will at least win 14 games, maybe even undefeated this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I do not know about undefeated, but I can see 14 wins happening."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on man 16-0 and undefeated postseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I am worried about the Patriots, Seahawks and Raiders this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they will be good, but we will be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That optimism, I hope you are right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am, Brady is older, Wilson isn't near the passer Rodgers is and Carr was lucky less season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, all I know is in Rodgers we trust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but now we have a team that is ready to compete."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the offensive line will do this season?"
