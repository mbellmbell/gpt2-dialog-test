"__HORROR__ I watched that movie, Dead Silence, that you recommended me!"
"__HORROR__ Did you like it!?"
"__HORROR__ I did! It was really scary! How did you know dolls creeped me out?"
"__HORROR__ Don't they creep everybody out?"
"__HORROR__ Good point. That wall of ventriloquist dummies really freaked me out though!"
"__HORROR__ The dead boy as a puppet is what really scared me!"
"__HORROR__ That was really weird too. I was surprised at how they began the story too, they kind of jumped right in."
"__HORROR__ Oh, you mean with the death of the main guy's pregnant wife?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah! Talk about jump scares!"
"__HORROR__ Tell me about it! What a movie though."
