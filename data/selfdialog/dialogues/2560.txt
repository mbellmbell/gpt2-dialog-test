"__MUSIC__ So I'm looking to add some songs to my workout playlist, any suggestions?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I don't know if I'm the person to ask."
"__MUSIC__ How come? Do you not have tunes on when you run?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh definitely! I just happen to listen to top 40 all the time, is all."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, staying current and hip, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess, I just really like the beat and rhythms when I'm working out."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, pop does tend to have great timing for running."
"__MUSIC__ They just really make me want to move, you know? The tempo's perfect."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, well, do you have favourite top 40 songs that you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Hm. I guess Chainsmokers are always pretty great for running."
"__MUSIC__ They have some nice pieces--Roses is theirs, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love that one and Closer for working out."
"__MUSIC__ Don't Let Me down is theirs too, I've worked out to that one before."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I just really like that I can get lost in the rhythm."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty fair. Do you have any other recommendations?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't know about her other hits, but I like Zaza's Never Forget You."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've heard that one."
"__MUSIC__ It's not that special in terms of lyrics or anything, just a good strong beat to move to."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty much the definition of pop, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, exactly. And that's what I need it for, so it works perfectly."
