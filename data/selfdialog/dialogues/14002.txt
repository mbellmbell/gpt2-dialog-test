"__BASKETBALL__ The Hawks organization is influx"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they really are. Where do they go from here?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Milsap is got to be their top priority"
"__BASKETBALL__ Indeed. He is their best player"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. I also like that kid Schroeder. He is going to be a superstar in this league"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know about superstar, but he will be a very good player"
"__BASKETBALL__ They need a couple of more pieces though"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I agree with you. They have to add some shooters"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, especially since they gave up Kyle Korver"
"__BASKETBALL__ I didn't understand that move at all"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's what I'm saying this organization didn't know whether to blow this team up or to try and win games"
"__BASKETBALL__ They went out and got Dwight Howard last year, I'm sure he doesn't want to be a part of a rebuilding project."
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly. When Howard's not happy he can taint a locker room"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he's done that before. This is not a good look for the Hawks organization"
"__BASKETBALL__ It really isn't. No way any team takes on that massive Howard contract though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I have to agree with you on that one. They are going to have to work around him."
"__BASKETBALL__ At least he is still pretty good defensively. He still can defend the paint and he's a good rebounder"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he is, but you can't go to him in the post"
"__BASKETBALL__ No you can't be he's been like that for a while now"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, so they knew that when they signed him."
