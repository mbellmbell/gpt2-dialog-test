"__MUSIC__ Hey, I just downloaded Harry Styles new album!"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I've never heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding?! He's from the band One Direction."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't they do 'Story of My Life'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was one of their biggest hits."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that one, actually. How is his solo stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ It's great! 'Sign of the Times' is my favorite song off the album, but some of the other songs are pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Are any of the songs on YouTube?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I believe so."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll have to check them out."
"__MUSIC__ Make sure to look up 'Ever Since New York'. That's another really good one."
"__MUSIC__ Okay."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, what you planning on coming over this weekend?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I thought I'd stop by after work on Saturday."
"__MUSIC__ Saturday Night Live is doing a repeat of their Harry Styles episode. Why don't we just watch it when you come over?"
"__MUSIC__ Will he be performing some of his new stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he does both of the songs I mentioned."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds cool. I'll be by around 10 PM."
