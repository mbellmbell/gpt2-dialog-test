"__MOVIES__ Well sorry about that"
"__MOVIES__ It is good man"
"__MOVIES__ Peter jackson his directing is awful"
"__MOVIES__ I guess i am going to have to disagree with you"
"__MOVIES__ Why would you do that"
"__MOVIES__ Because his directing is actually pretty good i must say"
"__MOVIES__ No way it is way to over dramatic"
"__MOVIES__ But that is the point"
