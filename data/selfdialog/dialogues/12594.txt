"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was thinking we should have a superbowl party this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sounds like fun! What teams are playing again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This year it's the Patriots and the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hmm. I'm not a huge fan of either team, but I bet a lot of people here like the Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be really surprised if they didn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, then how should we decorate? Should we make it clear that it's a pro-Falcons party?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so. Let's just make some interesting snacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you have in mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When I watch football games, I always want pimento cheese."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense, for this part of the country."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. So I think we should definitely make that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. Do you have any other ideas for things we could do that's themed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like, do you have any ideas for food that plays homage to one of the teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I see. Let me think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did have one idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What was it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's silly, but I was thinking we could carve a watermelon into the shape of a helmet, and then put fruit inside it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too healthy to watch an NFL game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we should do it anyway!"
