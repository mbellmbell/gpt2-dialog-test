"__MUSIC__ What artists do you think should be inducted into the Rock 'n Roll Hall Of Fame?"
"__MUSIC__ The first one that comes to mind is Bad Company.  They were pretty much a pure rock 'n roll band in the 1970s."
"__MUSIC__ I heard John Mellencamp say he was a big fan of Paul Rogers. Strange that John Mellencamp got inducted before Bad Company."
"__MUSIC__ I think the Moody Blues should have been inducted a long time ago."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, they have a lot of songs that are constantly on classic rock stations."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird that bands like Deep Purple kept getting passed over in favor of artists like Michael Jackson and Madonna."
"__MUSIC__ You don't think Michael Jackson and Madonna should have been inducted? They have sold millions of records."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, they were popular, but they're not rock 'n roll. They belong in a pop music Hall of Fame. If there is such a thing."
"__MUSIC__ I can never understand why Abba was inducted. I don't even know why they were famous."
"__MUSIC__ They were big in the late 1970s, music was changing. About the time that disco got big."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think there were any truly rock 'n roll bands in the 80s?"
"__MUSIC__ There were some, most of them were labeled as heavy metal. Bands like Van Halen."
"__MUSIC__ Van Halen? Did you prefer David Lee Roth, or Sammy Hagar?"
"__MUSIC__ Most people will disagree, but I preferred Sammy Hagar."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite Van Halen song in the Sammy Hagar era?"
"__MUSIC__ Dreams. I remember watching the video of that song with the Navy's Blue Angels."
"__MUSIC__ That was a great song. My favorite is always Why Can't This Be Love. Sammy Hagar was a great singer."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard anything he's done since leaving Van Halen?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I know he started a band and recruited the bass player from Van Halen."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard anything of his lately either, hopefully there will be a Van Halen reunion with Sammy Hagar on vocals."
