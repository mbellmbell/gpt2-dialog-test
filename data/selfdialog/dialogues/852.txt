"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite radio station?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a few, though my area doesn't have as much choice as I'd like. WCLZ, WBLM, WBACH"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a variety - new/world/indy, classic rock and classical."
"__MUSIC__ I'd add jazz if there was a jazz station. I also listen to top 40 stuff too."
"__MUSIC__ Not a country fan?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really, that is to say  I love bluegrass and oldy timey Opry stuff like Hank Williams and Patsy Cline, but new not so much."
"__MUSIC__ You have a lot of country stations near you."
"__MUSIC__ Ugh yes, they come in the clearest and step all over the other stations."
"__MUSIC__ Lots of NASCAR fans in your area."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if we are going to stereotype."
"__MUSIC__ How's BLM in comparison to the HCN and CCC of your youth?"
"__MUSIC__ BLM is awesome and same as it ever was. Just a great mix of true classic rock. Few hair bands and one hit wonders, no Creed or Nickelback."
"__MUSIC__ Don't they do that thing every year, the A to Z?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! In fact I think it starts this weekend for the 4th. It takes about two weeks I think."
"__MUSIC__ Every song in their catalogue, one letter at a time?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they have more than that in the catalogue but they switch it up. They play a lot of cuts that were never radio hits."
"__MUSIC__ So cool! So you will hear a song from an album you once owned but had forgotten."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! And because I spent so much time here as a kid before I lived here, it's like jumping back to 70s me!"
"__MUSIC__ Fleetwood Mac Rumors, Boston. Doobies, Jackson Browne, James Taylor JT, Steve Miller... ahhhh."
"__MUSIC__ Those were the days, my friend. :)"
