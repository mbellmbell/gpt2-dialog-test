"__MOVIES__ Did you see the preview for Dead Pool?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! I wouldn't have missed it."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it fantastic? There were so many great scenes! And, Ryan Reynolds nailed the character of Wade WIlson."
"__MOVIES__ It was awesome!  My favorite scene was the opening sequence."
"__MOVIES__ The slow mo action sequence was genius.  But, I laughed hardest during the montage of dates Wade and his girlfriend went on."
"__MOVIES__ YES! The Calendar Girl montage!  Did you notice that the skipped from Lent to Halloween?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, in all fairness, I'm not sure, aside from 4th of July, you could make psuedo-sexual scenarios about Memorial Day and Labor Day."
"__MOVIES__ You lack imagination.   But, ok.  What did you think of the two Xmen they introduced?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought Mega Sonic Teenage Warhead was perfectly cast!"
"__MOVIES__ No joke! She owned that role.   I loved the dynamic she had with Deadpool."
"__MOVIES__ Their verbal sparring was legendary."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  And, every scene with Darpinder, in the cab, was magic."
"__MOVIES__ I have a secret urge to see Darpinder become an Xman, now.  His superpower could be settling romantic disputes."
"__MOVIES__ I think it would be awesome for Deadpool's Blind Roommate to become an Xman."
"__MOVIES__ What would her super power be?"
"__MOVIES__ Building IKEA furniture and super-hearing."
"__MOVIES__ Not bad.  Are you excited for the sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely!  I saw the preview and it was hysterical."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean the one-off Musical where they sing 'Gaston' from Beauty in the Beast or the Easter Egg where he changes in a phone booth?"
"__MOVIES__ I hadn't seen the musical preview but I will look it up when I get home."
