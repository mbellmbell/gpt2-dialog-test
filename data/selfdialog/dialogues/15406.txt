"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think about Neville Longbottom?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I always felt really badly for him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I didn't feel bad for him, I thought he was kind of stupid."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't think that's fair, he was never made to seem stupid."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Neville couldn't even use a broom the first time he tried!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, that's true. But he had a troubled childhood."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How did he have a troubled childhood?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, Neville's parents were kept in St. Mungo's and didn't even know who he was."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I didn't know that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he was raised by his grandma, who always treated him like he was a Squib."
