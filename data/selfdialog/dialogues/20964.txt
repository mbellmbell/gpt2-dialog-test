"__THRILLER__ Did you see the Dark Knight?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes I did.  Awesome Joker."

"__THRILLER__ Yeah, plus him and Bale had a good back and fourth."
"__THRILLER__ Don't forget two Face."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah a little overlooked due to Ledger and his Joker."
"__THRILLER__ I know.  Unfairly so because he was awesome too."
"__THRILLER__ I like how Batman at the end took the blame for Dent dying too."
