"__MUSIC__ So, were you ever into the 'nu metal era' of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's kind of embarrassing how much I used to be into it."
"__MUSIC__ I think a lot of people were. It took the world by storm."
"__MUSIC__ What bands did you used to listen to back then?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to love Slipknot."
"__MUSIC__ I always thought their masks were so scary. Their music was good, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah when 'Iowa' came out I remember thinking it was the angriest release ever."
"__MUSIC__ I used to play the song 'Left Behind' on repeat."
"__MUSIC__ The chorus to that song is so catchy."
"__MUSIC__ They were unique and had a lot of shock value."
"__MUSIC__ Their vocalist also is in Stone Sour. They're very different musically."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know. I think they're both good."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It shows how diverse Corey Taylor is as a musician."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever listen to Korn back then?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I did. Korn was awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I actually liked them more than Slipknot. The sound was more relatable to me."
"__MUSIC__ Jonathan Davis has a very unique voice."
"__MUSIC__ He does. They have a lot of really good songs."
"__MUSIC__ Their old albums are awesome. I haven't liked many of their newer songs."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. It seems like they're trying too hard now with the electronic elements."
