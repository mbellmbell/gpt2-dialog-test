"__COMEDY__ Are there any comedy movies with Jack Black that not many people know about?"
"__COMEDY__ Yes, Orange County is one you might like."
"__COMEDY__ That sounds cool. Is Jack Black in it a lot?"
"__COMEDY__ He is not the main character, but he is a huge part of the movie."
"__COMEDY__ Cool, I will check that one out."
"__COMEDY__ He is also in The Cable Guy. But, his part is small."
"__COMEDY__ I would like to see that since I want to see his early work too."
"__COMEDY__ Orange County is very funny though. You will like it."
"__COMEDY__ I hope so. What is it about?"
"__COMEDY__ A guy who gets rejected to a school and then he tries his best to get in, with Jack Black's help."
