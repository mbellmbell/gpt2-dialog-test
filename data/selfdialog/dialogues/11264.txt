"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for football season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know man. It is going to be awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just watched a video on some of the best receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool. Did Julian Edelman make the list?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did, but I am unsure why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I haven't really seen him make too many great catches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he had an awesome SuperBowl catch! A nearly impossible catch!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but that is one play and I don't feel as if a play defines a player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. I like him though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Edelman too but Malcolm Mitchell is my favorite Patriots receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? No way. Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We went to the same university and I respect his work"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, okay. That's understandable."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also, I think that it is amazing that he made it to the Patriots fresh out of college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it is pretty amazing. He is really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Amari Cooper, from the Raiders, too. He went to the University of Alabama."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, nice! That's where Julio Jones went."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they have an awesome football program."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nick Saban, the coach, is awesome."
