"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I watched something interesting called the Attic Expeditions the other night."
"__MOVIES__ That rings a bell, but I don't think I've seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it came out back in 2001 so it's a little older."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's got Seth Green and some other people you probably wouldn't recognize, at least I didn't."
"__MOVIES__ Oh Seth Green is a pretty good actor."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's the star in it.  It's definitely a weird movie."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a guy who's in an insane asylum because he killed his girlfriend.  But he starts to question if he's really insane."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love insane asylum movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a good one.  And there is a sinister director of the asylum who he begins to question."
"__MOVIES__ Are there other interesting patients?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, the whole place is quirky and bizarre.  He begins to doubt his whole reality."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like my kind of movie!  Is the ending good."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's definitely interesting.  I think you'd enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ I like movies that question what is real and what is fantasy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, this one definitely makes you think.  And it makes you question mental illness as well."
"__MOVIES__ Good, I will put it on my list to watch.  Seems like Seth Green is getting older!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he is."
