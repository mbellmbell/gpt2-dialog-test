"__THRILLER__ Have you seen all the Mission Impossible movies?"
"__THRILLER__ for sure, how could I miss Tom Cruise's stun, it's too visually exhilarating"
"__THRILLER__ that's for sure, especially the one where he's climbing the tallest tower in the world--Raj Khalifa"
"__THRILLER__ oh, that one really got me on the edge of seat, especially later I realized it was real stunt, not CG"
"__THRILLER__ yea, Tom Cruise always tend to do stunt himself, and for that I really respect him"
"__THRILLER__ you know in the next movie, he jumped into a water cooling server center to hihack their data?"
"__THRILLER__ yeah, he was blacked out when holding breath for too long"
"__THRILLER__ I read news later that he was actually trained to hold breath more than 3 minutes under water by some specialists from SEAL"
"__THRILLER__ you mean the SEAL from USA special force?"
"__THRILLER__ yea"
