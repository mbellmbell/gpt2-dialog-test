"__ACTION__ Have you seen the latest Wonder Woman movie?"
"__ACTION__ Yes, I saw it over the weekend with my husband. We both loved it. Have you?"
"__ACTION__ Yes, I went last week. I thought it was one of the best super hero movies I have seen in a while."
"__ACTION__ I agree, great casting with the two leads in particular. I love Chris Pine."
"__ACTION__ Me too. I wish his character wasn't killed off. But he did a fantastic job."
"__ACTION__ I know. I think it had some of the best fight scenes I had seen in a while. I love how strong and able the women were."
"__ACTION__ Me too. It was great to see Robin Wright to so well. She was incredible and the lead was outstanding."
"__ACTION__ I have never seen her in anything other than the Batman V. Superman movie where she played Wonder Woman."
"__ACTION__ I saw her in that too. She did not catch my attention as much, but I remember she was good."
"__ACTION__ She was, but this was by far a more demanding movie. What a fantastic role model for young girls. She is so capable."
