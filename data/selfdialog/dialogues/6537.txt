"__STAR_WARS__ In a fight between all of the Jedi and Sith, who do you think would win?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like, Sith or Jedi, or an individual person?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Individual person."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm. Well. Maybe Yoda? I don't think we ever really saw him lose a fight."
"__STAR_WARS__ See, my money's on the Emperor."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Emperor? Really?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. He only lost because of a surprise attack."
"__STAR_WARS__ But only Vader was capable of making an attack like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ You may have something there."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still think it's Yoda all the way."
