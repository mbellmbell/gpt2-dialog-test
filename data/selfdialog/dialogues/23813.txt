"__SUPERHERO__ who gives the best performance of batman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Tough call, but I go with michael keaton."
"__SUPERHERO__ Really?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, I know the more popular choice may  be christian bale but keaton is strong in the role and I always associate him as batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Do you also prefer that era of batman films?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think part of the child me does, but I do think the nolan batman films are stronger overall."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree the Nolan series of batman movies are far superior to the 80s made batman films."
"__SUPERHERO__ But didn't first seeing those stick with you more to your idea of who batman is?"
"__SUPERHERO__ You assume I am also a child of the 80s , Adam West was my first idea of batman, so no."
"__SUPERHERO__ Interesting, I sometimes forget about adam west. Maybe it is generation thing which batman you think is best and not actually based on acting chops."
