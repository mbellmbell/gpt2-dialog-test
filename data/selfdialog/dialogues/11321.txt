"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the best quarterback is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Out of any team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, any team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd have to say Drew Brees."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow.  I just think he's totally overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What!?!  The guy holds tons of records!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know he does.  I mean, his single season stats aren't on point lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's still pretty awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously?  The Saints haven't done well in a while."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe it's more the rest of the team than it is him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  The guy is getting old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at how old Tom Brady is!"
