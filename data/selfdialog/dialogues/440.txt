"__MUSIC__ What's the craziest concert you ever went to?"
"__MUSIC__ Woodstock 99. It was 3 days of crazy, but it was an awesome crazy."
"__MUSIC__ What made it different and more crazy than other concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ The people walking around NAKED. I never saw that at any other concert."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my God. I would have died laughing. Did you stare a lot?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I was too busy taking pictures!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh how funny. But- wait- wasn't that the Woodstock where they had a fire?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and it was all because of stupid Limp Bizkit."
"__MUSIC__ What did they do?"
"__MUSIC__ He told everyone they were going to tear the place down, and then yelled for everyone to tear the place down."
"__MUSIC__ And so the fans did?"
"__MUSIC__ The staff handed out candles to everyone for a sunset vigil, and everyone used the candles instead to start fires. But they wouldn't have done it if stupid Fred from Limp Bizkit wasn't yelling at everyone to tear the place down."
"__MUSIC__ He sounds like a jerk."
"__MUSIC__ Some girls supposedly were raped in the mosh pit during that set. I stayed at the back of the field because I knew that band had a reputation for violent mosh pits."
"__MUSIC__ What were some of the nice things you saw?"
"__MUSIC__ Rage Against The Machine playing slow to calm everyone down. Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers playing with blue hair and naked. People who were nice to other people."
"__MUSIC__ What was something crazy YOU did?"
"__MUSIC__ The plywood wall around the event was painted with murals. At the end everyone started breaking off pieces of the plywood so they could all take home small painting sized pieces of the mural. And I took a piece too."
"__MUSIC__ If you had the chance to do it again, would you?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, because it was like a different world, and everyone felt so free, which is why they went naked, and it felt so alive and such an adventure."
