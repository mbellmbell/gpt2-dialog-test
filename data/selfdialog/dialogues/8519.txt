"__BEATLES__ Have you ever really listened to a compared songs from the Beatles first few years until there last?"
"__BEATLES__ Not really, why?"
"__BEATLES__ Well they change so much from their first songs that were fairly innocent and light."
"__BEATLES__ I mean, I guess that is true. I Want To Hold Your Hand is very different from Let It Be."
"__BEATLES__ Oh they are worlds apart."
"__BEATLES__ They definitely get deeper as they go."
"__BEATLES__ And sometimes a little weirder. Like I Am The Walrus."
"__BEATLES__ Well yeah, maybe that speaks to some of their substance abuse issues."
"__BEATLES__ Maybe, but no matter what they are still one of the best bands of all time in my books."
"__BEATLES__ I think anyone who really knows music would agree."
