"__MUSIC__ Did any of Yngwie Malmsteen's singers come back after they were fired?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  The first time I saw Yngwie live was back in 1999, and Mark Boals was back in the fold!"
"__MUSIC__ Where was that show?"
"__MUSIC__ It was at the I-Rock Nightclub in Detroit."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of that place.  How was the show though?"
"__MUSIC__ Mark Boals was in very fine form!  His voice was amazing and he sang amazingly."
"__MUSIC__ What about Yngwie?  I heard he goes through bad periods sometimes with his live playing."
"__MUSIC__ He was off in some ways, he seemed to pick the notes randomly.  I've seen him play really good and melodiously also though."
"__MUSIC__ When was that?"
"__MUSIC__ At the Royal Oak Music Theater one time.  He was playing with three fingers instead of four."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard about that, what's up with that?"
"__MUSIC__ I think he overuses his pinky by using it to play the forth and fifth notes.  That involves stretching the pinky and using it twice as much as the other fingers."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm.  The smallest finger and you're using it twice as much, sounds unhealthy."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's what I think it is.  Just jog your hand a little and use your index finger and your pinky instead of overusing your pinky!"
"__MUSIC__ So, any other good songs you've listened to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I was listening to Leonardo the other day.  It's from an album that came out in 2000 and it features Mark Boals on vocals."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, so that's a good one?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I like it a lot; it's about Leonardo Da Vinci."
"__MUSIC__ Amazing!  I think I'll listen to that on Youtube when I get home."
"__MUSIC__ Great idea, that's where I was listening to it!"
