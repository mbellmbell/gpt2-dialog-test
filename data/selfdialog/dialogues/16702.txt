"__MOVIES__ You know the kinds of movies that I wish they would make?  The ones like Buster Keaton used to make!"
"__MOVIES__ You mean ones that were heavy on the physical comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, sure -- they *did* have a lot of physical comedy, but they also had a satisfying story to them too."
"__MOVIES__ Like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! The physical comedy was a part of it -- you knew the moviemaker was just playing with you -- but the story had a payoff too."
"__MOVIES__ Like in The General by Buster Keaton: comedy, adventure, romance; but there *was* a interesting story."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  Who do you suppose makes movies like that anymore?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking Liar, Liar by Jim Carrey: there was a comedic story, there was physical comedy -- but there was also a moral, and a heart."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Jim Carrey is who I was thinking of too.  Did you ever see Man on the Moon?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't think so. Wait, was that the one with the song by R.E.M.?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one. It's actually the biography of Andy Kaufman, who sometimes showed up on Saturday Night Live."
"__MOVIES__ The guy who would wrestle women? That was kind of a weird schtick!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, but even though it was a biography, it had comedy, and a heart.  It's too bad Andy Kaufman didn't become a movie star!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he had the 'physical comedy' part down -- that's for sure. Wrestling when people expected jokes: who knew?"
"__MOVIES__ And he kind of had the 'stone face' that Keaton was famous for: you never knew if Andy was sincere -- or putting you on!"
"__MOVIES__ You know who I'm thinking of: Adam Sandler! Would he be someone like Buster Keaton?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh -- that's a good choice!  Remember Happy Gilmore: that golfing comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah!  Or how about Bill Murray in Caddyshack?"
"__MOVIES__ Or Bill Murray in Stripes -- or Groundhog Day?"
"__MOVIES__ I see what you mean: comedy, heart and action -- all rolled into one! You're right: we need more movies like that!"
