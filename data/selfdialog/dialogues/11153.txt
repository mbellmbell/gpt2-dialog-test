"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just got my season tickets for the Dallas cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't believe you bought season tickets. The cowboys suck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the steelers haven't had much to brag about these days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just wait - they're going to turn things around this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure. And Tom Brady didn't under inflate those footballs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man the Pats sure got off easy over that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. You'd think the Browns or Green Bay would try it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think anything would help the Bengals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's up with them? They make crappy draft picks!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least that's one thing Dallas does well. I have to give em that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And with Romo at the helm, it's gonna be another great season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But Dallas is a one-man team. If romo gets hurt, it's all over"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the problem with too many teams today - they have one star player instead of building a real team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know how the Pats can stand Brady getting all the attention."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Colin Kaepernick is just as bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man you'd think he'd focus on the game instead of getting involved in stupid media shit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Face it, Seattle hasn't been the same since the Steve largent days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right. I'd give anything for a Warren Moon type of QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well at least the Cowboys still have Thor best cheerleaders in the league v"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's about the only good thing I could say about the Fallas Cowboys."
