"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do you like?"

"__MUSIC__ Same here. The Beatles are probably my favorite band of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, for sure, The Beatles are legendary. What's your favorite album of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough call, but I would probably have to say Rubber Soul. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ The White Album for me, I love the way that they experimented with totally new ideas."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was definitely a game changer. 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' is one of my top Beatles tunes."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, one of George Harrison's finest. He went on to do some great solo work as well."
"__MUSIC__ He sure did, going solo really gave him a chance to shine and show what he was capable of."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Lennon and McCartney really exerted a lot of control on the songs, which I get, but it was great to hear all the songs George had amassed over the years."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I really loved the fact that he was more in tune with his spiritual side. His work was really special."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. What other bands are you into?"
"__MUSIC__ Led Zeppelin was another big one for me."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, for sure, you'd be hard put to find a better guitarist than Jimmy Page."
"__MUSIC__ His guitar work was legendary! The musicianship across the board really was stellar."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, so many great songs that will live on in history."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. I really love the way that they incorporated mythology into many of their songs as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there was definitely a mysticism about the band. I always really loved their heavier stuff."
"__MUSIC__ They really were epic in every sense of the word."
