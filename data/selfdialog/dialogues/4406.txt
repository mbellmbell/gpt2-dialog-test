"__MUSIC__ I don't understand new music sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ What are you talking about? 'New music'?"
"__MUSIC__ For example, you remember when like 10 years back dubstep became huge?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh huh. It took a few years to really catch on, but yeah, it was the pretty hot thing for a while."
"__MUSIC__ Well, for me, I didn't understand any of it. I didn't get the appeal, and I didn't like it."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it just wasn't to your taste? Or maybe you're getting old?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not just dubstep though, it's lots of new musical styles. Take vaporwave for example."
"__MUSIC__ What's wrong with vaporwave?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't understand it. I even tried looking it up, and I found out vaporwave evolved from seapunk, witch house, and chillwave."
"__MUSIC__ Shoot, that's not even getting into sub-genres of vaporwave like hardvapour or Simpsonwave which is more of a visual experience."
"__MUSIC__ See, that proves my point! I don't know what's going on with modern music!"
"__MUSIC__ I think people simply like things like vaporwave because it's an alternative to the hyper-manufactured pop-styling you get in the Top 40 on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ But isn't that the point of alternative radio stations?"
"__MUSIC__ Alternative is basically just bunch of  Foo Fighters or Coldplay inspired bands who aren't popular enough to hit it big, but aren't original enough to stand out."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty harsh. Then what do you consider to be regular rock?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Rock' basically just refers to post-grunge nowadays, like Nickelback or again, Foo Fighters, with a bit of 'rap-rock' thrown in."
"__MUSIC__ Rap-rock? What constitutes as that?"
"__MUSIC__ You know, like Linkin Park. It's basically radio friendly standard rock music, but with a few rap verses thrown in here and there."
"__MUSIC__ Point made. Still, even if a lot of that music is unoriginal and pretty derivative, at least I understand it, unlike vaporwave."
"__MUSIC__ True, even I don't see the point of things like Nightcore. I guess there's a place for both kinds of music, though."
