"__MUSIC__ I was really sad when George Michael passed away."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too. We've lost too many legends over the past few years."
"__MUSIC__ Like Michael Jackson. That was a hard one."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I never really liked him much. I really miss Whitney Houston, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she had a beautiful voice. I really like that song she did for The Bodyguard Soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ 'I Will Always Love You'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. It's sad, but it's really romantic, you know?"
"__MUSIC__ I agree."
"__MUSIC__ Gaps some of her earlier stuff was really good, too. Like 'The Greatest Love of All'?"
"__MUSIC__ I was in elementary school when that song came out. We used to sing it in chorus."
"__MUSIC__ I bet that was fun."
"__MUSIC__ What other songs of hers do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I really love the upbeat songs as well. Like 'I Wanna to Dance with Somebody'?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! I haven't heard that one in ages."
"__MUSIC__ 'So Emotional' is another good one."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I don't think I've ever heard it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm pretty sure it was on that same album."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I never got the albums. Just heard what was played on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ You should check it out sometime. I'll send you a link to the YouTube video if you want."
"__MUSIC__ That would be great!"
