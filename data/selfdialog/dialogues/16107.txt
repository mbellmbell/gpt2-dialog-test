"__ROCK__ So what, for you, is the best decade for rock music?"
"__ROCK__ Well, it's a hard question, because so much has been out there... but I probably say the 1970s."
"__ROCK__ The '70s? Really?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, well, people tend to think of it in terms of disco and some of the cliche classic rock bands, but a lot of cool stuff was going on."
"__ROCK__ Well, if your broaden your scale to include Germany, you get their experimental rock scene and the birth of electronic music."
"__ROCK__ Not necessarily the 'birth,' I'd take issue with that, but yes, techno music as we know it, electronic dance music, for sure."
"__ROCK__ You have Giorgio Moroder doing that stuff with Sparks by the end of the decade. That's a great album."
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah, and that's my point, because if you look at rock music in 1970, it's all a bit sludgy and turgid blues-rock."
"__ROCK__ Sure, and then progressive rock and punk rock came along to wake up everyone."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, the 1970s are a story of artistic revitalization and rebirth, and that's what appeals to me about them so strongly!"
