"__MOVIES__ Did you see that there is a remake of Baywatch coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw. I'm not sure if I will see it but I do like The Rock."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I understand. I feel like 90% of movies coming out nowadays are remakes or sequels."
"__MOVIES__ I know right? I wish there were more original ideas coming out of Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ I mean there is another Transformers movie coming out this summer!"
"__MOVIES__ What is that like the fourth one? They are all the same movie to me."
"__MOVIES__ I think it is the fifth movie actually."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear that Michael Bay said they had like 16 other Transformers movies already written?"
"__MOVIES__ You've got to be kidding me! This is the exact opposite direction Hollywood should be headed."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately it is all about money."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I know. The big blockbusters are what the studios bank on. I am just over explosions."
"__MOVIES__ I hear you. I definitely prefer the more artful movies like Moonlight."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Moonlight! I was so happy that it won best picture."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did like it a lot. Definitely more than La La Land."
"__MOVIES__ I liked La La Land but I thought as a musical it was just okay."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the singing and dancing was average but I thought the cinematography was absolutely beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ It was a shame about the mix-up at the Oscars for best picture though. I felt bad for both movie's camps."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I cant imagine what it feels like to hear you won only for it to be snatched away."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah although I did not love the movie La La Land, the feeling of winning and then ultimately losing had to be brutal"
"__MOVIES__ I agree but everyone on stage was respectful to both movies in the end which was really nice."
