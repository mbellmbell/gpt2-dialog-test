"__HARRY_POTTER__ What do you think is better the first Dumbledore or the second?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Richard Harris was my favorite. The other guy was okay but Ian McKellan would have done a great job too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're just saying that because of his role in Lord of the Rings. He did have that Dumbledore quality."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Agreed but it's not that. His eyes twinkle in the way I imagine Dumbledore's would also."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he could have easily pulled that off. Makes you wonder about the choice for Gilderoy Lockhart. I heard Hugh Jackman...."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he's just cheesy enough. I think he would have been better. Me too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ McGonnagal was a good choice."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, can't believe that is Grandmama from Downton Abbey!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know but she still has that quality about her."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, you definitely want to stay on her good side. She's great."
