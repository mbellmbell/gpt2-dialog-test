"__MUSIC__ Hey, what is your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like older country and bluegrass. I also like 1969's and 70's folk."
"__MUSIC__ When you say older country, what do you mean,"
"__MUSIC__ I really connect with Johnny Cash, Ferlin  Huskey, Patsy Cline. Those were the good days of country... Great ballads and real music."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It's hard to compete with Ring of Fire, Crazy or Hello Walls."
"__MUSIC__ I could listen to Cash all day. And real roots music... Just a bass, guitar, mandolin and fiddle."
