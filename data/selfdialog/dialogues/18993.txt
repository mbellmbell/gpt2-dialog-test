"__MOVIES__ I'm really looking forward to the new Dark Tower movie."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know much about it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever read the Dark Tower series by Stephen King?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I hadn't. I'm surprised they haven't already made a movie out of it if it's a Stephen King book, all the others become movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, this might be the last one that wasn't a movie yet."
"__MOVIES__ I've found Stephen King adaptation movies to be a mixed bag."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. I think Dark Tower could be cool, though."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a mystical desert land, and a gunslinger who is chasing an evil sorcerer."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, sounds like a genre clash! You don't usually get guns and magic in the same movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the world is kind of unique."
"__MOVIES__ Who plays the gunslinger and the sorcerer?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure who plays the sorcerer, but Idris Elba plays the gunslinger. And he's awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Elba is pretty cool. I liked him in Luther."
"__MOVIES__ And the Wire!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. I heard they might make him the next James Bond."
"__MOVIES__ I could see it. But for now, he's Roland, the gunslinger."
"__MOVIES__ I'd probably go see this Dark Tower movie. I like Elba."
"__MOVIES__ Do you want to go see it when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I'm up for it."
