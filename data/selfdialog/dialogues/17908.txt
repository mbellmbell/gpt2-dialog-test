"__MOVIES__ Hi! What kind of movies do you like watching?"
"__MOVIES__ I like dramas and romantic movies. What do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I like funny movies. What is your favorite movie then?"
"__MOVIES__ I like The Vow. It's one of the most touching romantic movies I've watched in a while."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't really watched that yet, what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a woman who gets in a wreck with her husband and completely looses her memory and forgets she was with him. It's a complex story but a good one, it's also a true story."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! That's crazy! So did she stay with him then. That would be so odd being with someone you don't remember."
"__MOVIES__ She did, and then she left, and then she came back again, in between going back to her old fiance. It was really sad for the guy."
"__MOVIES__ That is very sad, I still may watch it though. Who played the characters?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember them all, but the main characters were Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay! I like movies that Rachel McAdams plays in, she's a good actress."
"__MOVIES__ Yes she is, I've seen a lot of her movies. If you like funny ones, I'm sure you've seen mean girls."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That movie is so bad but so funny, she plays Regina George very well."
"__MOVIES__ I know right! I still like to watch that movie as a guilty pleasure every now and then, it is so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you watched Norbit?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's really funny too."
"__MOVIES__ I had to buy it when it came out on DVD, I've watched it so many times. That is my favorite funny movie."
"__MOVIES__ I've watched it once, anything with Eddie Murphy is really entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ That's another reason I love it, I watch all the movies with Eddie Murphy!"
"__MOVIES__ I've watched a lot with him as well."
