"__MOVIES__ Did you see Cars 3 yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't. I really wanted to though."
"__MOVIES__ It is actually really great. It helps wrap everything up."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like it would be great. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about Mc Queen and how he is becoming an old racer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that is kind of different. Does he win?"
"__MOVIES__ You will have to watch the movie to find out!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok. Thanks for not ruining the movie for me."
"__MOVIES__ No problem. I had somebody do that to me with the movie, Logan."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I heard that people were going around spoiling that movie for everyone."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I tried to see it is as fast as I could, but it still was spoiled before I had seen it."
"__MOVIES__ That happened to me with The Sixth Sense."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow! What happened?"
"__MOVIES__ As I was walking in to the theater, somebody said the ending to one of their friends."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that is the absolute worst. Did you say anything to him?"
"__MOVIES__ You better believe it! I told him that was incredily rude!"
"__MOVIES__ Good! Some people need to be told that some times!"
"__MOVIES__ It ruined the movie for me, but in the end the movie was ok at best."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The twist was really the only good part about it."
"__MOVIES__ I think so too. It wasn't as good as everyone thought it was."
