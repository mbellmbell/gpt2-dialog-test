"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you think's going to win the NBA finals this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It has to be the Warriors right, they are too strong. Who do you got?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I like the Cavs, they still have LeBron, the best player in the world."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but the his team gas looked good in the playoffs but they been some bad teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ Indiana and Toronto are not bad teams!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes they are, they wouldn't even sniff the playoffs if they were in the Western Conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes they would. Who has the Warriors played anyways?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Blazers and Utah. Utah is a great young team and the Blazers have Lillard."
"__BASKETBALL__ True but you can't seriously tell me that either team is better than Toronto."
"__BASKETBALL__ Toronto has no heart, they choke in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Just like the Warriors last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ No you didn't! Ok last year was bad but this year they have Kevin Durant."
"__BASKETBALL__ It won't make a difference because LeBron has owned him in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but he was on a different team and a different system. The warriors are too efficient with too many weapons right now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why don't you talk to me if you get past the Spurs, because it's not given that they can even beat them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh please. The old and slow Spurs without Tony Parker and a hurt Kawai."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hey they beat them 2 out of 3 this year and the Spurs are 8-1 without Kawai."
"__BASKETBALL__ The first loss was the first game of the season when they were still figuring it out and the last one they didn't even play their starter. They have too much talent and look better than the Spurs all around."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ok let's make a bet, $20 says the Spurs or Cavs  beat them this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Make it $100 and it's a bet. Unless you are too scared."
