"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Roque One"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was pretty awesome"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was really good, even thought you knew the end game."
"__STAR_WARS__ They, based on the original movies you know everyone dies, but it was still good."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like 'The Force Awakens' also"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, they finally got back to what Star Wars really is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked most of it.  Parts of it were stupid."
"__STAR_WARS__ Which parts were that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ When the girl, who didn't know she was a Jedi and had never trained, beat up Kylo Ren"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that part was a little lame."
