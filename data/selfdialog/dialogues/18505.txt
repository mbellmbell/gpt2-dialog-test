"__MOVIES__ I'm spending time with my daughter today and she is wanting to watch a good animated movie, any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ Has she seen any of the Disney princess movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah she loves all of them, especially Frozen, Snow White, and The Little Mermaid."
"__MOVIES__ My little girl loves those to. She can sing all the Frozen songs by heart."
"__MOVIES__ My daughter walks around all day just singing all the song from that movie to."
"__MOVIES__ Have you all watched the newer movie Moana?"
"__MOVIES__ No we haven't seen that one. Is it a Disney movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is the newest movie from Disney. I bet your daughter would really love that one."
"__MOVIES__ Who all stars in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Dwayne Johnson plays a large part in it and another girl plays this strong female role."
"__MOVIES__ We may have to check that one out. I love it when she watches movies with strong female lead roles."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that is definitely a great way to instill confidence in little girls."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any new Dr. Seuss movies out these days?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. The last movie I remember is The Lorax."
"__MOVIES__ Oh even I love The Lorax."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it has some really great songs in it and definitely a great meaning behind the story."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I think it teachers kids a great lesson."
"__MOVIES__ I think it teaches them how in order for things to change in this world, they need to care and want to see a change and then do something about it."
"__MOVIES__ It is definitely a great movie and teaches some really great lessons."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I think I might just go watch that one again myself."
