"__BASEBALL__ Are you keeping up with the Rangers this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not as much as last year...they are really struggling."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, they have had a hard time fielding, hitting, and providing good relief pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ Well...that pretty much sums up what a baseball team does...ha!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah...but they did just win their sixth game in a row!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, nice, they are back in the hunt?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not so much...the Astros won five-in-a-row until Texas finally picked up a game on them."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, on the bright side, Texas usually whips up on the 'stros. Well, usually."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees did beat the 'stros today and are playing the second game of a doubleheader."
"__BASEBALL__ So, do we have to root for the Yankees!?"
"__BASEBALL__ Absolutely, not! We just root that Houston loses every one of their games against non-Yankee teams."
"__BASEBALL__ That's right, you never, ever root for the Yankees!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, my greatest sports moment was watching A-rod strike out at the ballpark, the year Texas made it to the first World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ I was there!"
"__BASEBALL__ No way! Are you serious...I would give so much to go back into a time machine for that moment!"
"__BASEBALL__ Ha...well, I remember thinking for the first time ever that I was in a baseball town."
"__BASEBALL__ Hmm, for some reason, Hamilton didn't get that same sense."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that was tough when he left Texas and criticized the fan base."
"__BASEBALL__ I'll tell you one thing, if we ever get a time machine...I am going back to Game Six and pulling Cruz out of the game!"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, man, you had to bring up Game Six...I am now sad."
