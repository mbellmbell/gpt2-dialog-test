"__MOVIES__ I heard that you haven't seen the movie Scarface, is that true?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, I've never seen it!  I actually refuse to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Why?  It's such a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I just really don't like gangster movies.  It irritates me for society to glorify violence."
"__MOVIES__ well yeah, I can see that, but Al Pacino is so great in it.  I don't think it glorifies anything violent."
"__MOVIES__ How can you say that? The whole movie is about drugs and violence!"
"__MOVIES__ How do you know that if you haven't seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Because I've heard that from many people and I've read descriptions of it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, in my opinion it shows the dark side of those things.  You see how much damage it can do in the characters' lives."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I can see that perspective, but I still don't enjoy watching that kind of thing."
"__MOVIES__ Really, you should watch it just to say you've seen it!  It's an American classic."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I have held out this long and I don't plan on changing that anytime soon."
"__MOVIES__ Well fair enough.  At least tell me you've seen the Godfather?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope!  I refuse to watch that too."
"__MOVIES__ You gotta be kidding me!  So do you watch anything with violence in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I do, but I just try to avoid movies that I think glorify violence and crime.  There's too much of that in society today."
"__MOVIES__ There always has been.  I don't think it's necessarily getting any worse."
"__MOVIES__ I think it definitely is getting worse!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but it's not the fault of the movies.  The movies are just a reflection of society."
"__MOVIES__ They're supposed to entertain me, and watching others engaging in those behaviors does not entertain me."
