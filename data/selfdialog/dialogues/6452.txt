"__STAR_WARS__ Whatever happened to Hayden Christensen?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, you mean young Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he was Anakin Skywalker at the time, not Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ He technically was Darth Vader at the end of the third film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Fine, whatever.  My point is that he doesn't seem to have done much after Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ He probably made a boatload of money from portraying Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ Speaking of which, how did Darth Vader even survive?  I mean, he was pretty beat up."
"__STAR_WARS__ Guess they got him those new body parts just in time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if his suit has good air conditioning."
"__STAR_WARS__ You have way too much time on your hands."
