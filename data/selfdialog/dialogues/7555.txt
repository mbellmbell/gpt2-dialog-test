"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you think is the most overrated Lady Gaga song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Honestly, probably Million Reasons."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really? I thought it was nice that that song was a little more sophisticated than her older music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Eh, I would rather listen to Monster or Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's funny because those are the songs I find most overrated."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Are you serious? Those songs are classic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't think they give her much credit. Lady Gaga is much more talented than those songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You've got to be out of your mind. I love near the end of the Bad Romance when you can hear all the emotion in Lady Gaga's voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, but Million Reasons actually has more meaning behind it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree."
