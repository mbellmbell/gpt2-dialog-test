"__HORROR__ Have you ever seen Salem's Lot?"
"__HORROR__ No I haven't. What's it about?"
"__HORROR__ It's an old vampire movie.  It's actually the scariest movie made in my opinion."
"__HORROR__ Really?  Why?"
"__HORROR__ The first time I ever saw it i was a child and I guess it made a big impact on me."
"__HORROR__ I can understand that."
"__HORROR__ There is a scene where this kid is in his room at night and he is woken up to a vampire kid scratching on his window trying to get it.  It was really creepy."
"__HORROR__ That does sound scary and I am not even a child!"
"__HORROR__ I'm telling, you, you should definitely watch this movie."
"__HORROR__ Well,since it is scary I will wait and watch it with a group of people during the day!"
