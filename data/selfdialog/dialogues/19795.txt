"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the movie Holes?"
"__MOVIES__ I remember the name, but not what it was about."
"__MOVIES__ It's based on the book Holes. It had Shia Labeouf in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the one where the kids had to dig all day?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you saw it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, for school. Do you like that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Its in my top 10 of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, why?"
"__MOVIES__ Everything about it. I love Shia, Zero was cool, and just the whole story is great."
"__MOVIES__ The one thing I remember is the lizard scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, when Zero and Stanley found the treasure and were covered with them."
"__MOVIES__ And the only reason they weren't killed was because of how many onions they hate."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great scene!"
"__MOVIES__ Its too bad Shia turned into a bit of a crazy person in real life."
"__MOVIES__ But his movies are still good."
"__MOVIES__ I remember him from Even Stevens the most."
"__MOVIES__ That show was so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ He was the funniest character on Disney Channel back then."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ Here's hoping he does more comedy"
