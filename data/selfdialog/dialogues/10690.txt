"__FASHION__ So, I read that bell bottom jeans are coming back in style. What do you think about it?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure I would wear them, but seems like everything that has gone out of style eventually come back."
"__FASHION__ I think I would wear them, or at least try some on. I like that whole hippie, bohemian look."
"__FASHION__ I've noticed neon colors are coming back as well."
"__FASHION__ I won't wear neon, it's just too bright. I have seen some really pretty choker necklaces though."
"__FASHION__ I would totally wear those, I've seen them too in so many different styles and colors."
"__FASHION__ Have you seen Betsy Johnson's new line?"
"__FASHION__ No,not yet, looks like I will have to google it and take a look."
"__FASHION__ She's got so many cute shirts, purses and pajamas."
"__FASHION__ That she does. Seems like I can't get enough of her stuff."
"__FASHION__ I love her stuff too, not many people like her stuff though."
"__FASHION__ Everyone's tastes in clothing, etc is different."
"__FASHION__ Guess that's what makes us unique then."
"__FASHION__ I suppose so."
"__FASHION__ Another brand I like is the Lucky brand, I love the jewelry and clothes."
"__FASHION__ Me too, it's just so hard to find at a decent price."
"__FASHION__ Well, you know we both have excellent taste, although it may be a tad to expensive for our small salaries."
"__FASHION__ Yes, I know."
"__FASHION__ All this talk about clothing has made me want to go shopping. You want to go see if T.J. Maxx has any new Betsy Johnson stuff in ?"
"__FASHION__ Sure, let's go check it out."
