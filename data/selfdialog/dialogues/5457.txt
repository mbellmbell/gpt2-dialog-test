"__STAR_WARS__ How do you think they will handle Carrie Fisher's death in the upcoming movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that she finished filming her part in the next film, so Leia's death won't be in that one, I think."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or maybe they will add in her death into this film."
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like the audience won't want Leia to die in the films, it feels like too much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe she will go to another galaxy, or transform into something else?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I can imagine them making her transform into this spirit-type thing, and she will live forever."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I think that would be a great homage to her, and they could bring back Han-Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Whoa, yeah, that would definitely soften the blow, I think we definitely need to see him to be alright with her death."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or maybe her part in the second film was final enough that there doesn't need to be anything enough."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just hope whatever happens, it doesn't ruin how amazing she made the role."
