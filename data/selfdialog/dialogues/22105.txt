"__DISNEY__ Did you watch the latest remake of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I really dislike Emma Watson."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! Plus the animated Disney version is much more fun."
"__DISNEY__ It is. It's a nice little story about love conquering demons, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess so. Love taming the best within."
"__DISNEY__ Everyone could probably use a bit more love then."
"__DISNEY__ You've got that right. We're all beasts at heart."
"__DISNEY__ I just want to have talking tableware."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! The singing teapot is amazing."
"__DISNEY__ A singing teapot would certainly make mornings better."
