"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ did you see the Super Bowl last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ most definitely"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ that was a completely stunning game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought it was totally over by half time"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yes, watching the Falcons give up that lead was an incredible reversal"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't stand the patriots, but that was a comeback for the ages!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ definitely. say what you want about Tom Brady, but he really does know how to win"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm definitely not the biggest Brady fan, but I agree that was truly impressive"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i would also say that Bill Belichick deserves a lot of credit as well. he kept them in that game"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ he didn't just keep them in that game, he motivated them to not quit, and gave them a playbook for the turnaround"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I was an Atlanta fan I would have been sick"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was a little sick watching their lead evaporate, and i'm not even a fan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons had such a high power offense that season, its a shame they couldn't take it all"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yes they were putting up huge stats on offense. it wasn't uncommon for multiple RBs to have hundred yard games with multiple touchdowns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep, but there defense wasn't exactly the best"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well compared to the patriots, their defense wasn't as good at all. the Pats defense put in a very solid year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ in the end, it helped them pull out the big game as they completely stopped the Falcons after the 3rd quarter"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ some people are saying that the last super bowl performance cemented Brady as the greatest of all time after that comeback"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there is a really good case to be made for that"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait til next season starts"
