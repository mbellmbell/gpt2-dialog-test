"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see the new Stars Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did! I can't believe they got everybody to come back for it."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's amazing to see Harrison Ford a part of the franchise again."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, and Mark Hamill."
"__STAR_WARS__ But what do you think they're going to know with Carrie Fisher gone?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, it's so tragic."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think George Lucas would ever replace her."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think so either. She was so integral to the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe they'll have some sort of flashback sequences with lost footage."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be a nice way to pay tribute to her."
