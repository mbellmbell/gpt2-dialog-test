"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the movie 'Babes in Toyland'?"
"__DISNEY__ No, not really. Who was in it?"
"__DISNEY__ It was one of Drew Barrymore's first movies. She was the star."
"__DISNEY__ I really don't remember. What was it about again?"
"__DISNEY__ It's about this girl who cares for her family and acts like an adult, refusing to ever be treated as a child until she's transported to Toyland on Christmas Eve,"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, I can't say I've ever seen that."
"__DISNEY__ That's crazy, but It is pretty old."
"__DISNEY__ When did it come out?"
"__DISNEY__ The original came out in 1961, and the Drew Barrymore version came out in 1986."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I really don't think I've seen it! I'll have to check it out."
