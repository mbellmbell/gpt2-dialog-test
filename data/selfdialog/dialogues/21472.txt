"__DISNEY__ I think The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of Disney's scariest movies."
"__DISNEY__ What? I loved the Nightmare before Christmas."
"__DISNEY__ I think it's way too scary for kids."
"__DISNEY__ I watched it as a kid and I might've been a little scared but it's not like I was scarred by it."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't you find some of the characters to be a little unnerving, like the mayor or the doctor?"
"__DISNEY__ Well that's one of the main themes, is that things can be different but they don't necessarily have to cause fear."
"__DISNEY__ How do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well on halloween Jack is celebrated but when he tries to deliver Christmas presents he's met with fear."
"__DISNEY__ I'd be afraid if he delivered my presents too! But the stop motion christmas scenes were pretty."
"__DISNEY__ They were my favorite part!"
