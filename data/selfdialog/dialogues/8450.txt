"__BEATLES__ Where are they from?"
"__BEATLES__ Detroit. They have a website with their upcoming dates."
"__BEATLES__ I wonder if it's all really old people at their shows."
"__BEATLES__ I think it said they actually get a lot of young people at their shows."
"__BEATLES__ They probably have heard their parents and other people talk about the Beatles, and want to get to see what the music was like."
"__BEATLES__ The band is really professional. They studied the songs, and use Beatle's costumes and instruments."
