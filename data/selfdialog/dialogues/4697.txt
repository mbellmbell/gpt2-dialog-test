"__MUSIC__ Are there any bands you listen to that have heavily gendered fan bases?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, for sure. This one band I love, The Hold Steady, tends to have a heavily male fan base."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. Craig Finn the songwriter for sure writes from a male perspective and doesn't have a great voice, he sounds like a big Springsteen fanboy."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, Springsteen idolization is definitely more male centric."
"__MUSIC__ So what can you tell me about The Hold Steady?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a highly literate, bar rock band."
"__MUSIC__ What makes them highly literate?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Craig Finn writes these really novel-esque lyrics and he tends to write concept albums."
"__MUSIC__ What are Hold Steady albums about?"
"__MUSIC__ Separation Sunday is about trying to find faith in something. There's a lot to unpack."
"__MUSIC__ Let's try to unpack it."
"__MUSIC__ There are five major characters on the album: Narrator, Gideon, Holly, Charlamagne, and Mary."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, and what's their deal?"
"__MUSIC__ They're all from Minneapolis. It's really an absurd story about drugged out twenty- and thirty-somethings and how their experience relates to Christianity."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think that sounds too interesting."
"__MUSIC__ It's not for everyone for sure, but it brings together all the songs in a way that adds to each of them."
"__MUSIC__ So the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but only if you're following the narrative across the songs. There are songs that are good, that get even better when you understand the story."
"__MUSIC__ That's a neat thing for fans. That the album keeps giving."
