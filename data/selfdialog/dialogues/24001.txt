"__SUPERHERO__ So, what is your favorite Marvel movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I like Captain America the most. What about you?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I like Iron Man the most. Why do you like Captain America?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, it's the typical underdog story line. Plus, I just like how honorable Captain America is."
"__SUPERHERO__ He's too goody two shoes for me."
"__SUPERHERO__ Is that why you like Iron Man - Tony Stark as the bad boy?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, I guess so. He's not perfect, he doesn't have everything in order."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's true. But, he just is too snarky for me."
"__SUPERHERO__ I guess that makes for good conflict in the Avengers movies, later on."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree - Tony and Cap have to work out their differences with each other."
