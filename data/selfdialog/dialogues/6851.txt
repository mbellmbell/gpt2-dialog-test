"__STAR_WARS__ So, who are Rey's parents?"
"__STAR_WARS__ If it's a character we've already met, there are only so many options."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, so who do you think it is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, we know she's not Han's or Leia's daughter. I think they would have known."
"__STAR_WARS__ She could be Luke's."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I suppose she could be. But again, wouldn't Leia know if Luke had gone off and had a kid?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe Luke didn't even know."
"__STAR_WARS__ That seems very Un-Star Wars like."
"__STAR_WARS__ Granted. So who's Rey daddy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Based solely on her English Accent, Ben Kenobi."
