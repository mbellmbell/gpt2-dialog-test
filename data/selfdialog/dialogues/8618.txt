"__BEATLES__ That's what I'm saying It should considered the group's last recorded album."
"__BEATLES__ But it's not because the record company messed up."
"__BEATLES__ I don't know if they messed up or intended all along."
"__BEATLES__ Either way it's stupid. Abbey Road IS the last album"
"__BEATLES__ Well at least the latest recordings from the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ And that's all that matters."
"__BEATLES__ At least both albums are good."
