"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite spell that they use in the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really like Lumos. I know that it's pretty practical, but I love how they can just have a quick light whenever they want. What about you?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Honestly, I like some of the Unforgivable Curses. I always thought Crucio was really interesting to use."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? The Unforgivable Curses have always scared me a little bit! Especially Avada Kedavra."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I can see how they'd be scary. I think you really have to mean them to use them though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That reminds me of how they always say the wizard doesn't choose the wand, but the wand chooses the wizard."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That makes me think of the scene in the Sorcerer's Stone when Harry is trying to find his first wand."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're right. He goes through a few and none of them really agree with him, until one pops out of the shelf that seems to be drawn to him in a sense."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's one of my favorite scenes in the entire series! I also like when they go to Gringotts for the first time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Seeing how they have to get down to their vaults is crazy to me, but I love that goblins run the whole bank."
