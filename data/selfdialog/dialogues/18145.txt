"__MOVIES__ What's up?"
"__MOVIES__ Not much. Just watching movies. You?"
"__MOVIES__ Coincidentally I'm doing the same. What are you watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Ouija: Origin of Evil starring Elizabeth Reaser, Lulu Wilson, and Annalise Basso."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that by director Mike Flanagan? I really liked his movies Oculus and Hush."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but I much prefer Absentia over hush but Oculus was absolutely fantastic! What are you watching?"
"__MOVIES__ That one Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling movie. The Nice Guys."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? How is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Ryan Gosling. It's great!"
"__MOVIES__ Big Ryan Gosling fan then?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm starting to be. Have been binge watching some of his films back to back?"
"__MOVIES__ Like what? What are some of your favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ Always hard to choose between good movies but probably Lars and the Real Girl, Murder By Numbers, and Fracture."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I loved Fracture! That's the one with the guy that played Hannibal Lector right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Anthony Hopkins. Another great hollywood and theater actor."
"__MOVIES__ I'd imagine. His film credits start all the way back to 1960's tv show A Matter of Degree and his first film was..."
"__MOVIES__ A Flea in Her Ear if you count televised movies or Red, White and Zero otherwise."
"__MOVIES__ I don't normally watch black and white movies but Red, White and Zero was really good. What'd you think of his 1969 role in Hamlet?"
"__MOVIES__ As Claudius? Pure perfection of course."
"__MOVIES__ That man can do no wrong. Going to be a dark day in Hollywood and much of the world when he passes."
