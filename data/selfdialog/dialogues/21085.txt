"__THRILLER__ Have you ever seen Kill Bill?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes it's one of my favorite thrillers ever. Tarantino is a genius."
"__THRILLER__ Yes I agree and that's my favorite movie by him."
"__THRILLER__ Do you like volume 2?"
"__THRILLER__ I like it ok but part one has a lot more action."
"__THRILLER__ I like that for whatever reason they kept her name hidden until part 2."
"__THRILLER__ Just to add an air of mystery I'm sure. I love the yellow and black suit she wore."
"__THRILLER__ That was to pay homage to Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury."
"__THRILLER__ Well it was a great homage because she really worked it."
"__THRILLER__ I've probably seen that movie a million times. The fight scenes never get old."
