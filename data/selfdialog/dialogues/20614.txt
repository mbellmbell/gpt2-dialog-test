"__THRILLER__ Does your family have any traditional movies you watch around Halloween?"
"__THRILLER__ We don't really celebrate much, but sometimes we'll curl up with snacks and watch Halloween."
"__THRILLER__ The original in the series?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah. I still can't see Jamie Lee Curtis today without picturing her in that role."
"__THRILLER__ Sounds like good scary times."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah it's kind of a long standing tradition, too. I can remember just hearing the classic music from that or if somebody would make similar sounds and as a kid it would give me goosebumps."
"__THRILLER__ Who knew that music would become so famous and such a trademark?"
"__THRILLER__ It's kind of like that morbid children's rhyme in the Nightmare on Elm Street movies."
"__THRILLER__ Don't even start with that. One time I had to turn the movie off in the middle of that song."
"__THRILLER__ You gotta love the impact of those well crafted thriller movie songs."
