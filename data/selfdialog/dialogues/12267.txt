"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL is the best sport around!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you, nothing else really compares in my book."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will have the best rookie season this year in your opinion?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a tough question!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt about it, it was a really deep draft class this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Deshaun Watson is going to have a great career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could very well be your rookie of the year actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, I watched him tear up a great Alabama defense to win a championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He reminds me a lot of Vince Young to be honest with you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see that, but I think he will be a much better NFL quarterback than Young was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ John Ross is another guy I could see having an instant impact."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is really fast, and he will have a good quarterback throwing to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly, and I think with AJ Green lining up next to him, things will be a lot easier early on his career."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a really good point. He will get a lot of one on one opportunities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Leonard Fournette is who I think will end up being rookie of the year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is an excellent pick actually. I could see him going over a thousand yards in his first year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is just so hard to tackle! He will be great in the passing game as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If I had to pick a rookie of the year, I would say either Watson or O.J Howard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea Howard looks like a really good prospect. Did he play at Alabama?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He sure did. I watched him over the years and I really like his game."
