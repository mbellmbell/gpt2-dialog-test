"__MOVIES__ Hey did you see the latest XXX movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a new XXX movie?  Wow, the other one is super old!"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  It's kinda wild they waited so long to make a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ For sure!  What's it called?"
"__MOVIES__ XXX: The Return of Xander Cage.  It's got Vin Diesel in it again."
"__MOVIES__ Whoah, he's still around.  Well, I guess he kinda made the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, like what would it be without him?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  So how was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was totally disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ Are you serious?  That's sad to hear."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I know.  I loved the original XXX."
"__MOVIES__ So did I.  Why did you think it was so bad?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I couldn't get into the plot.  The characters were also really lame."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean by lame?"
"__MOVIES__ They were poorly developed and I didn't recognize any of the actors or actresses."
"__MOVIES__ What was the plot even about?"
"__MOVIES__ I couldn't even tell you!  I was so bored and confused that my mind kept drifting off."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I hate it when that happens."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I even fell asleep at the end, which is sad to say during an action movie."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I will be sure not to watch that one."
