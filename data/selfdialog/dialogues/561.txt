"__MUSIC__ Do you like country music?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, though, mainly older stuff.  Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like I should like it, but I just can't seem to get into it."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe you could try some covers by country artists of songs you already like.  If you find ones you like then you might like some of their other songs."
"__MUSIC__ That might work, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like the song Life Is a Highway?"
"__MUSIC__ 'You're going my way', that one?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's a pretty good song."
"__MUSIC__ Rascal Flatts did a version of it for the Pixar Cars soundtrack that was pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, I think I've heard that.  It was pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ So, you could listen to a few of their songs and see if you like any of them."
"__MUSIC__ I could do that."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think country music is all that far from rock or pop, especially some of it.  In fact, you probably already like some songs, but in your head they're not in the country category."
"__MUSIC__ Patsy Cline and Johnny Cash are, like, two top country artists of all time and I bet you like at least a few of their songs.  Crazy, I Fall to Pieces, Ring of Fire, I Walk the Line, like any of those?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh.  Yeah, I do, I guess you're right, I didn't really think of them as country singers."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes, someone gets well known enough that their music seems to transcend genres.  Of course, sometimes the music comes from more than one."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I'm having a hard time thinking of more than a few."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it doesn't happen all that often, but think about Elvis Presley.  He did all kinds of genres."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I guess he did do country and rock and gospel."
