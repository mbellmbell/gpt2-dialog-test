"__MUSIC__ How's that coffee?"
"__MUSIC__ Good.  It goes well with the opera I am listening to.."
"__MUSIC__ Opera?  How did you become interested in opera?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw the move 'Philadelphia' with Tom Hanks and in it, his character is trying to describe what opera is like to his lawyer while listening to a cut"
"__MUSIC__ I remember that scene!"
"__MUSIC__ It moved me so much I started  to listen to opera online."
"__MUSIC__ Is it very complicated, opera?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes and no."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ i like it for the emotion that it creates and evokes in the listener. So that's the 'no' part of the answer to your question."
"__MUSIC__ i think i understand that."
"__MUSIC__ The 'yes' part of the answer about opera is that it is so complicated that it's crazy"
"__MUSIC__ what do you mean?  Isn't the emotion just right there on the surface"
"__MUSIC__ yes, but opera knowledge is a very hard thing to come by.  They are usually in Italian."
"__MUSIC__ i don't speak italian!"
"__MUSIC__ Neither do I.  And then there's the matter of all the OPINIONS about the performers, their styles, the orchestral skill and so on"
"__MUSIC__ so the nonemotional part of opera takes away the fun of it?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  If a study of opera gets to heavy or too hard, i just take out my Tosca tracks, turn them up and lose myself in the emotion"
"__MUSIC__ I love that."
"__MUSIC__ I love it too.  It's almost not worth it to study opera.  It's more worth it to listen to it."
