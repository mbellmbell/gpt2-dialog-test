"__MUSIC__ John Williams has got to be the greatest composer ever."
"__MUSIC__ John Williams? I feel like I know that name."
"__MUSIC__ You should! Among other things, he did the soundtracks for Harry Potter and Jurassic Park."
"__MUSIC__ Jurassic Park! That's iconic!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, right? I cried when the trailer for the new movie came out, simply because they used a few well-placed notes of the original theme."
"__MUSIC__ Talk about capitalizing on nostalgia. And the Harry Potter theme is nothing to forget, either."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, even when Williams wasn't composing the soundtracks anymore, they still had to keep using his theme song as, well, a theme throughout the movie."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, John Williams didn't compose all the Harry Potter soundtracks?"
"__MUSIC__ No, there were actually a few composers, including Patrick Doyle and Nicholas Hooper."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard of any of those people."
"__MUSIC__ I mean, they're not bad, but they're no John Williams."
"__MUSIC__ What else has Williams done?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you know, little old projects like Jaws, ET, and Star Wars."
"__MUSIC__ No way! You'd never really think to connect the dots on that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's pretty interesting, because once you know what you're listening for, you can kind of hear some of his habits and trends."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I don't think I have a good enough ear for that."
"__MUSIC__ Honestly, I don't either, but there are some times that I'll listen to a song from a movie from the eighties or nineties, and it will have kind of a Harry Potter vibe to it."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Isn't that like reusing your old work?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, maybe kind of, but I think he just has a certain style."
"__MUSIC__ And I guess you'd repeat yourself a little bit with so many different songs under your belt."
