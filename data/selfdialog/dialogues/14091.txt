"__BASKETBALL__ I really want the Spurs to win the Finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I really like watching Leonard play."
"__BASKETBALL__ It is nice to see someone play on both sides of the ball for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah the fact he isn't being more considered for MVP is a crime."
"__BASKETBALL__ I totally agree."
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean who else in contention plays defense as well as him."

"__BASKETBALL__ Well that is true but I think we have Lebron fatigue."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah it seems like people do that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah everyone wants to race to anoint the next great one."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup its become a real problem.  If I had a vote it would go to Lebron for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but I think this year Westbrook is going to win."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah everyone seems to love him."
"__BASKETBALL__ I am not sure why though."
"__BASKETBALL__ He only plays offense and he only plays offense for himself."
