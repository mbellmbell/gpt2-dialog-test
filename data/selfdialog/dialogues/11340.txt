"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about some of the new rules in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really have a problem with much of the new rules. But I do hate how players get penalized for celebrating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think some celebrating is okay, but I really hate when players go overboard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but to me, that's what makes the game fun. I like seeing the over the top celebrations from some players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't. Some of these guys act like clowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I would figure that scoring a touchdown in the NFL would be exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but these players are getting paid good money to do their jobs. They need to act more professional."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think some celebrations need to be banned. But for the most part, let these guys have some fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess one of the problems I have with it is that it takes too much time away from the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's something I can agree with you on. If a celebration stalls the game too much, then it should be penalized."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Other than celebrations, you don't have a problem with the other rules?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, not really. What new rules do you not like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was never a fan of kickoffs being done so far into the field. It pretty much eliminates most returns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do agree with that. But I think they did that because too many people were getting hurt from kickoff returns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that's part of the game. To me, if it's exciting, I want to watch it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know. I would rather players stay healthy so I can watch them actually play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But kickoffs are part of the game. The NFL has already been too soft with so many of the things that used to be legal in the sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it is frustrating to watch some of the rules that prevent defensive players to play like defensive players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I want to watch a sport where football players have the freedom to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So more violence is acceptable to you, but celebrations are over the top? Okay."
