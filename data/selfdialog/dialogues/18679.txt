"__MOVIES__ He is my least favorite character in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ My least favorite was Baby."

"__MOVIES__ Just the tone of her voice and that laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, her laugh was terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I did like Otis in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ He was the one with the long hair right?"
