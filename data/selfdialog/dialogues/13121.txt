"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how are the Steelers going to do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a chance to be really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they're better than last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, as long as Martavis Bryant comes back strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you think he can be a big difference maker?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely, they lacked that strong number two receiver last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He stretches the field too, doesn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you have to respect his deep threat at all times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But how do they beat New England?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have to start playing man-to-man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they have the players to do that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not, but Brady is going to burn you either way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But doesn't man-to-man make it worse?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Death by 1000 cuts is no better than losing to quick strikes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're looking at a blow-out then though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not if the offense can keep up and the aggressive defense creates a few turn-overs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do they make the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most likely not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How far do they go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'll probably lose in the AFC Championship to New England, haha."
