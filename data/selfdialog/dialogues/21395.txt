"__THRILLER__ I saw that movie Split last night have you seen it?"
"__THRILLER__ No, was it good?"
"__THRILLER__ It was definitely tense.  This guy takes these three girls from a parking lot and holds them hostage only he's got multiple personalities."
"__THRILLER__ Definitely sounds interesting.  Didn't M. Night Shyamalan do that one?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah and its kind of related to Unbreakable but I won't spoil it for you."
"__THRILLER__ Thanks, maybe he's making a come back."
"__THRILLER__ I think so.  The Visit was good too.  I never did hate his movies though."
"__THRILLER__ I thought Lady in the Water was an absolute bomb."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah, that one was no good.  People didn't like The Village though and I did."
"__THRILLER__ I though it was ok.  I called the twist from a mile away."
