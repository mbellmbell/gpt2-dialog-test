"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about the new take on the Star Wars universe presented in the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It was done well, but it was a bit too similar to New hope in many ways."
"__STAR_WARS__ How do you mean? How were they similar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rey is on a desert planet very similar to Tatooine and a lot of other things are very similar between the two movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see that. But I really enjoyed how they personified a storm trooper this time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that was very unique. I didn't expect to see a storm trooper using their own will."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Finn has some Force sensitivity?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There haven't been special indications of it, but there is always a possibility."
"__STAR_WARS__ Would you like to see his story line progress further?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It could be interesting but I'm always more interested in the mystical part of the Force and the characters most affected with it."
