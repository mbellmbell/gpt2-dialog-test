"__MUSIC__ What do you think of black metal music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I know what that is."
"__MUSIC__ So basically, it's a style of metal based on heavy distortion, tremolo picking, screamed vocals, and satanic lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ So basically what everyone thinks metal is already?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound very appealing to me."
"__MUSIC__ I can get why. The vocals alone are an acquired taste."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't understand how anyone can like music with unintelligible vocals."
"__MUSIC__ I used to think that way, too, but they I started reading the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Did that make a difference for you at all?"
"__MUSIC__ It made all the difference. I found out that there's a lot more depth to that type of music that most will just brush over."
"__MUSIC__ But didn't you say it revolved around satanic lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of it. That's a trait that popularized it, but not all black metal revolves around satanism."
"__MUSIC__ What other lyrics can you find in black metal?"
"__MUSIC__ There's a band called Immortal that does basically anything that all other black metal bands do, but their lyrics have more mythical lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Mythical how?"
"__MUSIC__ They have this concept of a land called Blashyrkh, which is essentially a land of endless winter. That's also a regular theme in black metal."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound too bad."
"__MUSIC__ It really isn't. If you're willing to give it a chance, I recommend you start with Immortal."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I will. I'll get on YouTube right now."
