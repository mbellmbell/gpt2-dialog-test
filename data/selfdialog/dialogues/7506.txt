"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you heard that new Justin Beiber Song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Which one? I feel like he has a new song every day now."
"__LADY_GAGA__ The spanish one."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh that Despacito one? I don't think that's a Justin Beiber song, he is just featured on it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh well that makes sense then."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What do you mean?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, he doesn't even know the words to the song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really? That's messed up."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw him at  a concert, and when that song started to play, he just said 'Blah blah' for most of the words."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Wow, that's pathetic."
