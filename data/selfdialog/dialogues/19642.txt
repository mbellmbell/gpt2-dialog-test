"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, The Shawshank Redemption, maybe."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's a good one.  Based on a Stephen King story, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like Stand by Me."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah.  It's been forever since I watched that."
"__MOVIES__ Remember the leeches?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Remember the story in it with all the vomiting?"
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, didn't like that part very much."
"__MOVIES__ John Cusack was in that."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was the older brother, in the flashbacks."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I guess he was. Think that was one of his first roles?"
"__MOVIES__ He was in Sixteen Candles before that."
"__MOVIES__ Sixteen Candles?"
"__MOVIES__ He played one of the geeks, you know, Farmer Ted's friends."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember that."
"__MOVIES__ Remember when he needs the picture of the drunk girl and nice car?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really.  I didn't really like the movie, so I've only seen it once and that was a long time ago."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well, okay.  He was in Better Off Dead, too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my god, yes, that's a funny movie."
