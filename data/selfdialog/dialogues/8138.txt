"__POP__ Shall we talk about pop music? Britney Spears is my favorite pop artist."
"__POP__ Oh! I love Britney, I actually got to see her at a show recently."
"__POP__ Yes I've loved her since I saw her her 2002 movie 'Crossroads'."
"__POP__ That's a great movie! I really liked her rendition of 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll'."
"__POP__ Me too! I'd say she probably did Joan Jett and the Blackhearts justice, do you agree?"
"__POP__ Totally I really liked the way she sung it, I might even like it better than the original version!"
"__POP__ What do you think of Lana Del Rey?"
"__POP__ I think she's great, I really love her songs 'Young and Beautiful' and 'High By The Beach'."
"__POP__ Those are some of my favorite songs by her too! I can't believe how much we have in common."
"__POP__ I know right! I really love pop music so it's cool to get to talk to someone with similar tastes about it, I don't get to very often."
