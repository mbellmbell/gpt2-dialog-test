"__MUSIC__ So, how do you feel about punk rock?"
"__MUSIC__ I love it! But the earliest stuff is the best, versus today's punk."
"__MUSIC__ Punk is still going strong today?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but a lot of people kind of call those musicians something like Civil War re-enactors."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by that?"
"__MUSIC__ The idea that they perfectly embody the fashion and music of the late '70s, but aren't really doing anything new on their own."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see. Well, what are some of your favorite punk bands?"
"__MUSIC__ I tend to like the ones from the '70s first wave of punk in the US, like Iggy and the Stooges, the Ramones, and Pere Ubu."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of the first two but not the last one. Who are Pere Ubu?"
"__MUSIC__ They were from Cleveland and made really weird music that was aggressive and had strange singing, almost like Devo would a few years later."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds kind of weird!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, well the cool thing about Pere Ubu was that their music really embodies a sense of place, a kind of urban industrial despair."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like '80s punk at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. It started to turn into what they call 'Hardcore,' with bands like Black Flag and Minor Threat, but I can't listen to them much anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Why don't you like hardcore punk?"
"__MUSIC__ The music just started to get kind of louder and faster but didn't really go anywhere after that, stylistically, which is also true of '90s hardcore."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, I see. So do you like British punk?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, definitely -- bands like the Clash are excellent and hold up well today."
"__MUSIC__ What is the most essential component of punk, to you?"
"__MUSIC__ The music has to be high-energy and intense, and express working-class values or concerns, like what it's like to be poor and hopeless."
