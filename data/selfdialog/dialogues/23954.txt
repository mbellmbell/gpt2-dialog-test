"__SUPERHERO__ Which X-men movie was your favorite?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Logan, for sure."
"__SUPERHERO__ You're just saying that because it's the most recent."
"__SUPERHERO__ Not true. The whole franchise IS Wolverine, and this was the last movie with him and gave him a good death."
"__SUPERHERO__ The time frame was weird though. It was only like fifteen years and every mutant is dead or dying."
"__SUPERHERO__ True, but maybe that's just a genetic defect: the modern era only saw mutants emerge in world war 2."
"__SUPERHERO__ I liked X-Men 2 the most."
"__SUPERHERO__ Why is that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ It's the highest rated, so there's that. Also, I'm religious, and they had a christian character! That never happens in these movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's true, religion does take a backseat. It's definitely a top movie, despite the religion that I don't like."
