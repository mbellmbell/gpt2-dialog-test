"__BEATLES__ Why is Paul so popular amongst the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Disproportionately? I mean, he was a main songwriter in the band."
"__BEATLES__ Maybe not disproportionately. I just wonder if there are reasons other than that."
"__BEATLES__ Well, he's really a pretty underrated bassist, for one thing."
"__BEATLES__ Hmm. How so?"
"__BEATLES__ His lines would be off on their own, not following the guitar with root notes."
"__BEATLES__ That's true if I think about it. Lucy in the Sky seems comes to mind."
"__BEATLES__ He's arguably underrated by this metric, since people falsely think technical skill is a great way to rate a musician."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. It's not like he's shredding all over the place. They're just memorable."
"__BEATLES__ And imaginative. You have to remember that especially in their early days, this is when much of rock n' roll was really laying the blues ripoff thing thick."
