"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and backing Joni Mitchell at the first Playboy Fest when she was doing Mingus stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I vaguely remember that. I wasn't ready for her doing jazz."
"__MUSIC__ You had a lot of company. I think her Mingus album sold fewer copies than anything she had ever done."
"__MUSIC__ People want to hear what they're used to."
"__MUSIC__ Which puts artist in a kind of prison."
"__MUSIC__ Especially the most creative ones."
"__MUSIC__ His last hurrah at Playboy was legendary -- not in a good way."
"__MUSIC__ How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was great, but he was clearly marching to his own drummer, so to speak."
"__MUSIC__ High?"
"__MUSIC__ Everybody thought so, including me. I couldn't believe he could play so brilliantly while impaired. Turns out it was probably his demons taking over."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder how much they informed his music?"
