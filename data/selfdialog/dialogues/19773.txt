"__MOVIES__ Hello Waldo, have you seen any good kids movies recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh hi, Vladimir, as a matter of fact I have."
"__MOVIES__ What did you see?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw Cars 3 with my kids a couple of weeks ago."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really good actually!"
"__MOVIES__ Better than Cars 2"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was.  It got back to the spirit of the original Cars movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's good, my four year old wants to see it.  Do you think he'll like it?"
"__MOVIES__ He'll love it, and you probably will too."
"__MOVIES__ That's good to know."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed trying to figure out who was doing the voices on the cars."
"__MOVIES__ I do that a lot with cartoons too."
"__MOVIES__ Nathan Fillion from Firefly was one of the voices.  I knew I recognized the voice, but didn't figure it out myself until after the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I bet that drove you nuts."
"__MOVIES__ It did.  I wanted to get out my phone and look it up."
"__MOVIES__ But you were good and waited until after the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, I can't be rude during a movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'm glad you have good movie manners."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks dude, I'll talk to you later!"
