"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, so what do you think was the worst part about the Phantom Menace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, man, just ONE worst part?  It's so hard to choose.. there's so many."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I know, but for me, it had to be the  Midi-chlorians."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, God, don't remind me of those."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, i mean, first film it establishes the Force as some kind of a mystical life force like 'chi' or something that binds the universe and then."
"__STAR_WARS__ And then it's all, 'No, it's actually just a bunch of microscopic bugs.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly! I really don't know what Lucas was thinking on that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hate to say it buuut..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, go ahead."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he was just giving a giant middle finger to the audience."
