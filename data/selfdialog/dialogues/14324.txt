"__HORROR__ What do you think is the best horror movie of all time?"
"__HORROR__ I'd have to say Rosemary's Baby."
"__HORROR__ Really, that's an oldie.  Why do you think that is the best horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ Because it really showed us the horror that lurks behind everyday life, especially in New York City."
"__HORROR__ Did you think that the actors that played Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse did a good job?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, Mia Farrow was the perfect choice for innocent Rosemary and John Cassavetes did a great job playing the creepy husband Guy."
"__HORROR__ Do you remember the part where the old neighbor lady gave Rosemary those drinks when she was pregnant?"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I do and that is why I never accepted food or drink from anyone but my own family when I was expecting!"
"__HORROR__ Did you know that the movie was filmed at the Dakota where John Lennon used to live?"
"__HORROR__ Wow, I didn't know that.  But that building really looked creepy and it looked like the perfect place for a bunch of witches to live!"
