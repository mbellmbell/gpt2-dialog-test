"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Would be a tough call, but if forced to choose likely Forrest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ Great choice! However as good as it is, not sure it should've won best picture over Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction"
"__MOVIES__ I disagree completely, don't get me wrong those are both great, but Forrest was and is better."
"__MOVIES__ What sets it apart in your mind?"
"__MOVIES__ So many things actually. Hanks is perfect in it and it's such a charming story."
"__MOVIES__ Fair points, but Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's best and Shawshank is a modern classic."
"__MOVIES__ Again I do truly enjoy both, but I've been on the historical journey with Gump more times than I can remember,  the rare movie I never get tired of."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough, I feel the same way about The Exorcist."
"__MOVIES__ Always felt it was a bit overrated,  I'm sorry."
"__MOVIES__ Overrated? That's blasphemous my friend, Damian Karras needs to give you an exorcism."
"__MOVIES__ Part of it may be that the sequels soured me a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Exorcist 2 was an abomination,  just awful, but part 3 Was better than it's given credit for."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah 2 was really really bad."
"__MOVIES__ Was almost like they were trying to make some sort of ironic statement that only they got."
"__MOVIES__ It was a confusing mess, I would agree than 3 did at least go a long ways toward getting 2 out of my mind."
"__MOVIES__ Then you had the prequel eventually."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah wasn't there two of them?"
"__MOVIES__ There were Exorcist the beginning and then another that was unreleased in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, may eventually watch them."
