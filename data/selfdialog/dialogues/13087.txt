"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know preseason football starts in less than one month?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't wait!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm excited for the Redskins, I think we're going to make the playoffs this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think they need to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they don't go to the playoffs, then Kirk Cousins will most likely walk, and then it's basically like they're starting over again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess you're right, but I think we have a good shot at making the playoffs this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibly, but I think in order to do that, it will be important to beat the other NFC East teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of our their new running back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like him. I think he will contribute right away and I think he has to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, we lost two great receivers last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they tried to work on their defense though too, which is a good thing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think our record will be?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will go anywhere from eight and eight to maybe ten and six."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think nine wins and seven losses will get us in the playoffs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not entirely sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, let's hope for ten wins and six losses then!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as they stay healthy, it's not out of reach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We should go to a game this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We should! Let me know what month you're thinking."
