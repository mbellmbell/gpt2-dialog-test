"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the game last night?"

"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, that was really something."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ There seemed to be a lot more fighting than usual."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, the two teams are rivals."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The penalty box was overflowing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, it was great."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You like the fights?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's the main reason I watch hockey."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's kind of barbaric, don't you think?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The players fight because it's expected. If they made stricter rules against it, it would stop."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Agreed. You don't see it as often in baseball and football."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm surprised there is so much fighting in hockey considering a lot of teams are Canadian."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah, they're usually so passive and nice."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But the fans are rowdy. They're crazy when it comes to hockey."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It's funny when they throw things onto the ice."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'd be worried about being kicked out."
