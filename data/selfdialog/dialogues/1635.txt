"__MUSIC__ If I said the name Reginald Kenneth Dwight to you, would you know who I was talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Is that your long lost uncle?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! I wish."
"__MUSIC__ You're going to tell me that's Paul McCartney's real name aren't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Close. That's Elton John's real name."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not surprised he changed it, but mind you, Elton isn't really a normal pop star name either..."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Elton John song then?"
"__MUSIC__ There's too many to mention, 'I'm still standing' is quite timeless though. You?"
"__MUSIC__ 'Sorry seems to be the hardest word' I think. Great tune and lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I remember the video for that, all mournful face, eyebrows making pyramids in his forehead. He could be an actor."
"__MUSIC__ I always wanted to be able to play 'Your song' on piano."
"__MUSIC__ My embarrassing secret is that I d never heard that song before the Moulin Rouge film."
"__MUSIC__ That's ok. For some reason he's never had the respect or constant radio play of the Beatles despite many classic songs."
"__MUSIC__ Very true and it's the same for the Rolling Stones. If they'd stopped 40 years ago they'd be utterly revered."
"__MUSIC__ I've always thought Jagger and Richards are more influential in music than Lennon and McCartney."
"__MUSIC__ I'd agree. You only have to listen to their 'greatest hits' album, it's song after song of perfection."
"__MUSIC__ What's that album called again?"
"__MUSIC__ '40 Licks'. There's playlists of it on Spotify if you've not got it already."
"__MUSIC__ I think I had it on CD but you've just reminded me to have another listen."
"__MUSIC__ Happy to be of assistance! It's only rock 'n' roll but I like it..."
