"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why didn't Peyton Manning win more Super Bowls?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He won two.  That's pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he is suppose to be a football robot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got to remember the Colts were terrible for his first 4 or so years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Colts were pretty good for the next 10 or so years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but the Colts never had a great defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not true.  They had a dominate defense a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Colts defense was fast but they were all small guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would you rather big slow guys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You need some size on defense or you can't stop the run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that is true.  The Colts run defense was never great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The whole defense was never great.  The Colts offense was just so dominate that it didn't matter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, back to the question.  Why didn't Peyton win more Super Bowls?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the easy answer is because of the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, those were some good games Colts vs Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the Patriots won the majority of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Colts never really could figure out the Patriots in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well we'll look back and realize that the Patriots are having one of the best runs in NFL history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Peyton should have won 4 Super Bowls with those teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, he won 2 and got to 3 Super Bowls.  That's pretty good in my opinion."
