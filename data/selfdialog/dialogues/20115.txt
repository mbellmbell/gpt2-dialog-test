"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet. But I really want to. Have you?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it on opening night. IT WAS AWESOME!!!"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard good things about it. Who plays Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Her name is Gal Gadot. She did  a great job. Whoever did the casting nailed it."
"__MOVIES__ I've never heard of her before. Has she been in anything else?"
"__MOVIES__ She was in some of the fast and furious movies."
"__MOVIES__ I've never watched those either. I can't believe they are still making new Fast and Furious Movies. They sound lame."
"__MOVIES__ I saw the 1st one a loooong time ago. It wasn't my thing. But anyways Gal Gadot was awesome as Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ How were the fight scenes?"
"__MOVIES__ They were really good! Made me feel empowered as a woman because she was kickin so much butt."
"__MOVIES__ Nice. Who directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Patty Jenkins. I believe Wonder Woman is the highest grossing film ever directed by a woman."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! That is pretty amazing. Isn't Chris Pines in it too?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he's in it and so is Robin Wright."
"__MOVIES__ Who is Robin Wright?"
"__MOVIES__ You know her! Jenny from Forrest Gump!"
"__MOVIES__ oh yeah! She plays Claire on House of Cards. She's a good actress."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she is. I kinda wish she had a bigger part in Wonder Woman."
