"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite time period for music?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like whether I like 60s music, 70s music, and so on?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's it. I'm really into the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay. I'm much more of a 70s person."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I really like the variety. You can get classic rock, punk, early New Wave, progressive rock, and so on."
"__MUSIC__ That's fair. But don't you like grunge and metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but there's no way you can beat bands like Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ I'll admit that I do really love some of those punk bands."
"__MUSIC__ It was an excellent mix."
"__MUSIC__ Still, some of those bands were still around in the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ So, you're saying that the 90s is offering the best of both musical worlds?"
"__MUSIC__ That's exactly what I'm saying."
"__MUSIC__ I don't buy it. Those bands weren't at their best by that point."
"__MUSIC__ I thought Pink Floyd's Final Cut was respectable."
"__MUSIC__ Respectable, sure. But how respectable?"
"__MUSIC__ It was respectable enough to sell really well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but there's no way it can stand up to Wish You Were Here."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe so. Thanks for the chat."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Thank you, too."
