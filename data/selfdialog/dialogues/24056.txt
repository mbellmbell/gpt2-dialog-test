"__SUPERHERO__ Are you a big superhero movie fan?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I am! The Marvel Universe is my favorite over DC."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh definitely. Have you seen Deadpool?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes I have, over and over. Ryan Reynolds is hilarious in it."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree, fantastic movie. Although not suitable for kids."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's for sure. He's very edgy and has trouble controlling his mouth."
"__SUPERHERO__ I loved all the Easter eggs, the references to the other time he played Deadpool and when he played Green Lantern."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes those are hilarious. I didn't realize he'd played Deadpool in the Wolverine movie. A different personality though."
"__SUPERHERO__ I can't believe how horribly he was tortured and still came out of that to get his revenge."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes that showed his resolve and how upset he was, and how much he loved his girlfriend."
