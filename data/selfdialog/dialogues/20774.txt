"__THRILLER__ The Ring? As in the original from years ago?"
"__THRILLER__ Exactly, it was recently added on Netflix."
"__THRILLER__ That movie is definetely scary, if I remember it correctly."
"__THRILLER__ Yep, it has the scene of the girl coming out of the TV."
"__THRILLER__ It's crazy! And she looked so demented."
"__THRILLER__ Sometimes I dream about that scene, no joke."
"__THRILLER__ Well, I can't watch The Ring at night for that very reason."
