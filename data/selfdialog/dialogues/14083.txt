"__BASKETBALL__ Are you watching the NBA playoffs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, the San Antonio Spurs beat the Houston Rockets pretty badly!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Rockets would have done better if James Harden played better tonight."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, he played well during the regular season, but did not perform as well during the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Now that they beat the Rockets, how do you think the Spurs will do against the Golden State Warriors?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Both teams are excellent.  That is why they are the first and second seeds in the Western Conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Golden State will win.  They swept the Utah Jazz easily to get here."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Golden State did win 67 games in the regular season."
"__BASKETBALL__ Stephen Curry has made Golden State a team that always wins a lot."
"__BASKETBALL__ But San Antonio won 61 games this season.  They are also very strong."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kawhi Leonard has done very well for San Antonio."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Warriors win in 6 games, but it will be a close series."
"__BASKETBALL__ I see the Golden State Warriors winning the championship too."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree.  I think the Cleveland Cavaliers will be their opponents in the finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Cleveland will win the Eastern Conference, but either the Spurs or the Warriors will beat them."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Cleveland just needs more strong players besides Lebron James."
"__BASKETBALL__ But Kyrie Irving is a another good player for the Cleveland Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but he is very young.  He will be better when he is older."
"__BASKETBALL__ Either way, I cannot wait to see who plays in the 2017 NBA Finals."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too.  2017 has been a great year to watch basketball."
