"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Metalica?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, who hasn't?"
"__MUSIC__ Well to be honest you would be surprised how many people don't know about Metalica."

"__MUSIC__ Somehow Metalica has made it for years and still sells records."
"__MUSIC__ I still think there is never going to be another rock group like Metalica."
"__MUSIC__ Its as if that genre has died."
