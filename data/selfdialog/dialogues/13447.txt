"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks still have Russell Wilson though, and a great defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right, and their division is not very good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I think the Cardinals will be very good this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but Carson Palmer fell off last year. If you don't have a good QB it's hard to be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they still have David Johnson and Larry Fitzgerald, those are some of the best players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their defense has taken a real hit too. I think the Seahawks win the west, but they're not as good as the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys are really going to rely on Dak Prescott being a great quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he is. He is better than the other guys in the division. Kirk Cousins is very overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right. I think Dallas can win their division, but I don't think they're as good as the Seahawks or Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons are one of Seattle's biggest threats. They have an elite offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did last year, but they got great years out of a lot of players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They still have Julio Jones and Matt Ryan, the MVP, plus a great running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They do, but the NFC South is probably the best division, they don't have a  bad team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not convinced the Saints will be that good, but you're right it's a strong division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Saints have Peterson now. I think their running game will be very strong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Adrian Peterson might be washed up. He's also always injured. I'm not sure he's enough to compete with the other teams in the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point. There's also the Packers in the North, they're always good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, the Packers are a strong team. So it looks like we've picked the division winners. Do you still think the Seahawks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, I think they're a better team than Dallas, Green Bay or Atlanta, and they have the experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but Atlanta and Green Bay have both been to Super Bowls recently."
