"__STAR_WARS__ What's the one thing you remember the most about the first installment of Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Death Star. Always remember when Obi-Wan Kenobi said 'that's no moon. '"
"__STAR_WARS__ Were you surprised when Darth Vader killed Obi-Wan Kenobi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I was, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a Jedi master.  Nobody should have been able to beat him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Ewan McGregor did a good job portraying Obi-Wan Kenobi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was okay, but Alec Guinness is the actor who will always remind me of Obi-Wan Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru know who Obi-Wan Kenobi was?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably, I imagine they tried to hide it from Luke so he wouldn't go to fight in the rebellion."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think Obi-Wan Kenobi decided to train Luke at his age? After all, Yoda said Anakin was too old when he was a small child."
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably because Luke was the last person who could be trained to be a Jedi. He was the only one who could use the force."
