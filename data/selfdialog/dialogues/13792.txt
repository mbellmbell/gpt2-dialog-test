"__BASKETBALL__ It looks like it will be the Warriors and Cavaliers again in the NBA Finals this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, this is the third year in a row now."
"__BASKETBALL__ It should be a good tie breaker. Who do you think wins?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's tough to say, both are playing great basketball right now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Definitely! The Cavalliers just beat the Celtics by like 40!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah that was crazy."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Kevin Love will be the X factor for the Cavaliers this year. He was injured their first year and didn't play that great last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he will have to play well this time. It's going to be a tough match up against arguably the defensive player of the year, Draymond Green."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. Now that the Warriors have Kevin Durant he will likely guard LeBron."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and they still have Andre Igoudala off the bench to guard LeBron. He won't start this time."
"__BASKETBALL__ I still don't think they can slow LeBron down, the guy is just too good."
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably not but now he will have to guard Durant which will wear him down."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, in previous years they didn't have to worry about Harrison Barnes offensively. But Durant is one of the best in the league."
"__BASKETBALL__ Im more interested in the Kyrie Irving and Stephen Curry matchup again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Man Kyrie was insane last year. They had no answer for him, and the game winner in game 7 was beautiful."
"__BASKETBALL__ Curry isn't known for his defense, I would expect more of the same this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's where Klay Thompson will have to step up."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but he couldn't stop kyrie either last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Good point. I can't wait for the Finals to start!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Same here, only a couple of more weeks to go."
