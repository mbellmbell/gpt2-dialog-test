"__ACTION__ What did you think about Suicide Squad?"
"__ACTION__ On a scale of 1 - 10?  Maybe a 5."
"__ACTION__ That seems a bit low."
"__ACTION__ A few reasons for that.  For one, it definitely didn't focus on the Joker enough."
"__ACTION__ Okay."
"__ACTION__ And two, it was way too easy to kill the end guy."
"__ACTION__ It did take the fire gangster to do it though."
"__ACTION__ That's my point.  They should have just sent him in alone."
"__ACTION__ But then you wouldn't have a squad at all, just a guy."
"__ACTION__ I'm just saying.  Kind of made the ending weird in my opinion."
