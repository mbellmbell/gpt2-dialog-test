"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thursday Night Football. Necessary?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, before 'Monday Night Football' and Saturday night sometimes there were more games on sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it was harder to watch all the games on sunday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but now with DVR's and NFL Red Zone, you can wach most of the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't you do the same with the games on different nights?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but those games cut into other programming i may be recording on those nights."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hm, interesting point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the NFL wants to do different days, push more Pro games on Saturday. College sucks anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ College is an industry, i doube they are gonna give up that real estate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL is a bigger industry tho."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but that's why they divided the weekend up so they can rake in the bucks for the weekend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, doesn't mean i have to like it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you don't watch any college football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, doesn't excite me one bit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's too bad, there are some good college games out there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sorry, the scores and the plays are unrealistic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really do."
