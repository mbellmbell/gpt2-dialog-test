"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think the better Vader was?  Hayden or Jones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ James Earl Jones for sure, such a better actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure, Anikan in the prequels has more scree time.  Jones is just a fear factor. Not to mention voice only."
"__STAR_WARS__ Dude you're crazy.  Hayden was a winey little punk in episode 2.  And not as good an actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ You're right about the acting.  But his fighting was much better."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean the stunt double with the same hair cut?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Sorry, I just enjoyed watching Vader develop."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that was cool.  I just wish they would have chosen a better actor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lets agree on this.  Jar Jar binks was the low part of the franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh man don't get me started."
