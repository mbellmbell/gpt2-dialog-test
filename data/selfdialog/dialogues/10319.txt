"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hip Hop music. What happened to it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It got too mainstream I guess and oversaturated in the market."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I guess. The hip hop of today isn't anything like it was back in the 1990's."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No, it's not. It seemed more from experience and real life back then, unlike the commercialized garbage of today."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes. Dr. Dre and Snoop Dog and Tupac definitely were real."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think some time a few years later, things started to go south."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who do we blame for that?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I kind of blame Puff Daddy and people like Will Smith who made hip hop too pop-ish."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I could see that. Puff Daddy and Will Smith seemed to make hip hop more for the sense of just putting out music instead of putting out music from real life experiences."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ For sure. Hip hop isn't the only genre to suffer from the change of the century into today's music."
