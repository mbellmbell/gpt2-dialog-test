"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Linkin Park?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea! I love them! Do you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea I do. Did you know they are going to be in Seattle in October?"
"__MUSIC__ What? No I didn't! Are you going to go?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I have an extra ticket, too. Do you want to go with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Heck yes I do. I love their new song... what's it called again?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean Heavy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea! That is the one. It's so good!"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, it's really good. My favorite one is Battle Symphony. This new album is really quite good."
"__MUSIC__ That's good to hear, their last two were sort of let downs."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, it's been a few years since I've been really impressed."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if they will ever live up to Meteora."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I really liked the remix album they did with Jay-Z.."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yea! That was really good too. I wonder if they play any of those songs at their concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, but I would love to hear that stuff at the concert."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know who is opening for them?"
"__MUSIC__ No I don't, but I'm pretty sure Snoop Dogg is going to be there as well."
"__MUSIC__ No kidding?! What an interesting match."
"__MUSIC__ It makes a little sense, maybe they will do some remixes with him?"
"__MUSIC__ That would be amazing!"
