"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Djent?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so.  What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Djent is.. well, you know metal, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah.  I love metal."
"__MUSIC__ Okay.  And there are different subgenres of metal, like death metal, symphonic metal, that sort of thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know about those."
"__MUSIC__ Okay.  Djent is a subgenre of metal, with a focus on distorted sounds."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that doesn't sound good."
"__MUSIC__ But it is!  Do you know Meshuggah?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them before, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Meshuggah is considered by many to be the founders of Djent; their style of sound is what makes Djent what it is."
"__MUSIC__ Okay.  So it's.. what? Freeform jazz metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Not quite.  Djent is kind of similar to progressive metal, with an emphasis on complicated time signatures and patterns in the music."
"__MUSIC__ So it's like math metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah!  A lot of people actually call it that.  It's all about complication, with hard, heavy riffs and tones to back it up."
"__MUSIC__ Okay.  That actually does sound kind of cool."
"__MUSIC__ It is very, very cool.  Check out Meshuggah, or Periphery if you've never heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Why Periphery?"
"__MUSIC__ The guitarist, Misha Mansoor, is also very big in the Djent scene.  His work is really representative of what modern Djent sounds like, as opposed to the more classic Djent of Meshuggah."
"__MUSIC__ All right; I'll give them a listen.  Thanks!"
