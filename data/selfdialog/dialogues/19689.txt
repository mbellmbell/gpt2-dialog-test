"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see the new Star Wars movie when it comes out?"

"__MOVIES__ You should.  Have you seen the original ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I did when I was younger."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like those?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, yes.  I thought they were really cool.  Did you like the prequels?"
"__MOVIES__ They were disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I hated what they did with the characters.  They were super overexaggerated."
"__MOVIES__ I can see why you would say that."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I thought the special effects were really great."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, do you like things like that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think special effects make or break a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome.  So what movie  do you think has the best effects?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the cgi and effects from Avatar were amazing."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that was a really good movie, but I've never seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Wait you've never seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  Want to watch it with me sometime?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I'd love to."
