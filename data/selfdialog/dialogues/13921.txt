"__BASKETBALL__ I tell you the Wizards really disappointed me this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just feel like they didn't live up to their potential all of the way"
"__BASKETBALL__ I hear you, but I just feel like they went as far as their talent could take them."
"__BASKETBALL__ I disagree. To me they had a better team than the Celtics."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know how you could say that when the Celtics had the better record"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they did, but when you look at this roster, I felt they were more equipped for the postseason."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know about that. The Wizards always seem to underachieve"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they do, but that's my point. The talent is there for this team to be better."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe this is just who they are. I mean John Wall and Bradley Beal are a great backcourt, but something is missing."
"__BASKETBALL__ You mean as it relates to their chemistry?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. Like this whole team and organization just seem to be lacking something."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think that something maybe heart."
"__BASKETBALL__ You are probably right. They just can't seem to get out of their own way sometimes."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know watching this team can be frustrating at times"
"__BASKETBALL__ You keep expecting more, but again this is who they are."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think if they can add a few pieces they can be a legitimate title contender."
"__BASKETBALL__ Again I disagree. I don't know if John Wall is the leader that gets you there."
"__BASKETBALL__ I love Wall! I just think he needs a couple more guys that fit into their system."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think he is fool's gold. I'm going to say that Wall never wins a championship."
