"__LADY_GAGA__ What Lady Gaga song do you think would be good to work out to?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Applause would be a good uptempo song to excercise to."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, yeah.  I could picture that one playing during a spin class."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Maybe even Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That could work, too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ A lot of her songs have a fast tempo, don't you think?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah.  Born This Way is pretty fast."
"__LADY_GAGA__ So is Just Dance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Is Paparazzi fast or slow?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think it's in between.  It's not exactly a dance song, but it has a good tempo."
