"__STAR_WARS__ Let's talk a bit about some of these intermediary films. Do you think Rogue One was a proper Star Wars film?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know. What do you mean by 'proper'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I mean is it a respected part of the canon and up to the same quality as the others?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It definitely is. It's politically a very interesting movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean because of a group of rebels going rogue or radical?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's a lot of it. The Rebel Alliance was fairly regressive."
"__STAR_WARS__ In what respects was it regressive?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they're really only working on behalf of royalty and other regressive political forces."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Rogue One showed a better way?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It did. It showed that people who really want to get things done don't necessarily listen to the official 'resistance.'"
