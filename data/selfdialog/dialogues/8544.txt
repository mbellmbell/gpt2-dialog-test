"__BEATLES__ I heard the Beatles were super into Indian music in the 60s. Trippy."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I know some of their songs use sitar, but I think it really depends which ones you listen to how much it actually sounds like Indian music."
"__BEATLES__ Oh?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, well the sitar on 'Norwegian Wood' really just sounds like a guitar part to me, just played on the sitar."
"__BEATLES__ True."
"__BEATLES__ But if you listen to something like 'Love You To,' that has way more Indian influences. I think George had taken more lessons by that point."
"__BEATLES__ What kind of Indian influences?"
"__BEATLES__ Drone, percussion, improvised bits, bent notesâ€”lots of cool stuff!"
"__BEATLES__ Are there any other songs that used the sitar besides the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah, definitely. Listen to 'Paint it Black' by the Rolling Stones!"
