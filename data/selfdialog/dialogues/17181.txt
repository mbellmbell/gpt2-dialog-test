"__MOVIES__ I saw Revenant with Leonardo Di Caprio last week."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I love that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too, it was dark but I think that was the best movie he has ever made."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a lot of his other movies are about him being good looking and smooth."
"__MOVIES__ But Revenant, he did such a good job in that.  He's all mangled and dirty and just his facial expressions are great."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, he looks like he's just running on pure hate for half of that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's so crazy that that movie is based on real life."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I can't even imagine what that guy must have gone through."
"__MOVIES__ The only thing I would have changed about that whole movie was that Domhnall Gleeson had such a small part, I love him."
"__MOVIES__ Who is, is he the guy from Harry Potter?"
"__MOVIES__ No that's Rupert Grint silly.  Domhnall Gleeson is Brendan Gleeson's son, the guy from Braveheart and Gangs of New York."
"__MOVIES__ Oh awesome, where else do I know his son from?"
"__MOVIES__ He plays General Hux in Force Awakens and Caleb in Ex Machina."
"__MOVIES__ Oh OK, yeah he looks really good in the period piece type costumes for Revenant."
"__MOVIES__ For sure, he just has that kind of face where he looks totally right for stuff from the 19th century."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, some people just look weird in those clothes but some people just look totally believable.  Like Daniel Day-Lewis, he looks great in period costumes but I think he would look totally weird if you tried to put him in something futuristic like sci-fi."
"__MOVIES__ I heard he's going to make one more movie and then he's retiring from movies for good."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That sucks, I loved him in Gangs of New York, no one else could have done that part."
"__MOVIES__ You know I heard when he does a movie he lives the whole time they're filming as that character, even when he's walking around off camera or just getting breakfast he still talks like he's the character he's playing."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know it I think that's super cool or completely crazy but I know I love the movies he's in so I guess I'm glad he does it."
