"__MOVIES__ There hasn't been a good 'Sword and Sandals' movie in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ What is a 'Sword and Sandal' movie?"
"__MOVIES__ They are movies that take place in Ancient Greece or Rome."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean like Gladiator?  Or Clash of the Titans?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is what I mean.  I think the last truly great film in this style was Gladiator."
"__MOVIES__ Gladiator was a superb movie."
"__MOVIES__ Whenever it comes on television, I still can't help watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too.  I love the scene where Maximus fights against the tigers."
"__MOVIES__ The arena battle scenes were all well done.  Joquian Phoenix did a great job as the emperor."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  What did you think about the movie 'Troy'?"
"__MOVIES__ It had a lot of potential, but I think it fell short."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty decent, but I think it was missing something."
"__MOVIES__ I think the movie would have benefited if it followed the book, 'The Illiad', with more of the 'supernatural' route."
"__MOVIES__ It would have been interesting to see the gods and goddesses influence on the different people in the story."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  I would have loved to see that."
"__MOVIES__ The action scenes weren't that bad in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the scene in the beginning of the film with Brad Pitt's character, Achilles, facing off against that huge warrior."
"__MOVIES__ That guy was massive!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the scene was going to be a long drawn out battle, but no.  Just one hit and Achilles took him out."
"__MOVIES__ I laughed out loud after he did that."
