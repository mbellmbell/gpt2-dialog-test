"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow the NFL preseason is only about a month away. Time flew this offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yuck, it will be the same old teams winning, all the ones I hate again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on now, your Vikings showed some potential last year, at least early on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they ended up jinxed as usual. Nothing changes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well who do you see winning the divisions this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd say Patriots, Steelers, Texans, Raiders, Cowboys, Packers, Buccaneers and Cardinals"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa...Buccaneers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think the Falcons will go in a tailspin after their massive choke job. Still mad about that by the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, why do other teams always choke and do the stupidest things against the organization that is always up to something suspicious. Weird."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Buccaneers were pretty good at the end of last year. Winston was coming into his own."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think Seahawks won't win NFC West?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a toss-up..I thought the Cardinals caught too much bad luck last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's bound to reverse itself, but I don't trust Palmer anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My one buddy from San Diego is convinced the Chargers will do well now that they've left, just to spite him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'll lose 60 percent of their starters to injury like usual, but still average 30 points a game..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And go 5-11 with eight losses in the final minute."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going Cowboys over Raiders for the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be a popular game to watch no doubt. I think both those teams are going to step back though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well who do you see winning the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gonna go Patriots over Packers."
