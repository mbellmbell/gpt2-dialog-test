"__STAR_WARS__ We gotta talk favorite villains."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, mine was definitely Boba Fett.  I mean, despite his silly name."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't really get the hype behind that guy.. he had like.. what, three lines?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Dude, he had a FREAKING JET PACK!  As they say on the internet, you're argument is invalid!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ahhh.. I think Darth Vader is cooler.  Boba can't block laser blasts with his fist."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but he also has all that cool gadgetry. Wrist mounted rope for the win!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ahhh.. he's alright.  Still going with Vader"
"__STAR_WARS__ All right?  He's got Wookie scalps for trophies!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wookie scalps?  Where did you see that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they don't explicitly show it in the film, but they detail it on the toy and stuff."
