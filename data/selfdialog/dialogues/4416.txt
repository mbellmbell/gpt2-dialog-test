"__MUSIC__ What are you listening to this summer? I'm really enjoying Halsey's duet with that girl from Little Mix."
"__MUSIC__ Lauren Jauregui? She's from Fifth Harmony."
"__MUSIC__ Is there a difference?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! Little Mix is from the UK."
"__MUSIC__ That's not much of a difference, honestly. But I like the song with Halsey."
"__MUSIC__ Halsey is fantastic. I like most of her music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but this one especially has been playing on repeat."
"__MUSIC__ So far this summer I'm loving Mary Lambert's new song."
"__MUSIC__ Which one is that? The one with the arcade or whatever?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the video is amazing, but the song is pretty fun on it's own."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't seen it or heard it. I heard about it from someone though."
"__MUSIC__ The song is so fun, and funny! It's about meeting someone and really liking them before you even know their name."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I want to see the video."
"__MUSIC__ It's amazing! It reminds me of Bad Blood by Taylor Swift, but it's geeky."
"__MUSIC__ Because they're in an arcade?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, but they are all playing video games and competeing against this mysterious player."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ It is. But the song does stand for itself also."
"__MUSIC__ That's good to know."
"__MUSIC__ Do you want to listen to it now?"
