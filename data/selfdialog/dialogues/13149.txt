"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would you do to improve the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the biggest thing that needs to be fixed is the overtime rule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it could use a little work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The biggest problem I have is that a touchdown wins but not a field goal. Why not have the other team get the ball after a touchdown as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The games would probably last to long then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they would but a great game can be ended with a kickoff return for a touchdown and it's not fair to the team who lost in that case."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you can't cover a kick you don't deserve to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but if it's a really good defense against a really good offense they should take the field at least once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well what would you do?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the college overtime system where each team gets the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They would need to move it back because NFL kickers are a lot better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then start it at the 50 yard line each time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would never end on a tie then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be the best part, who wants to watch a game that ends in a tie?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember when Donovan McNabb didn't even know the rules about ending on a tie?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he should have known better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is paid to play the game he should know the rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the college rules would make it even more exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some QBs would really up their stats too. Teams could score 14 points or more in overtime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be ok the stats changed when they changed the games from 14 to 16."
