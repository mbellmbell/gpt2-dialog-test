"__BASEBALL__ Here's what I'm wondering.. why is Michael Vick been giving a second chance, when someone like Pete Rose can't get the time of day?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, those are two different circumstances. Rose bet on baseball knowing that was THE cardinal sin in the game and that it would likely bring on a lifetime ban if he was caught.. then he stoutly lied about it for years"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, sure, but is that worse that what Vick?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, plus Vick DID serve a prison sentence, and, cruel as it might sound, there's no rule in football against running a dog fight operation."
"__BASEBALL__ Still say it's a crappy situation."
"__BASEBALL__ Hey, I'm not saying I endorse what he did by any means, but still... anyway let's change the subject shall we?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that sounds good."
"__BASEBALL__ So, do you think Donald Brown will make a big impact for the Indianapolis Colts?"
"__BASEBALL__ I really like him  in the colts offense.. he's like Joseph addai but with fewer miles on him.."
"__BASEBALL__ You, switching subjects... I think it was a snub to Jamie Moyer to move him to the bull pen when he's been the best pitcher Philly has had in awhile."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know, I mean, I like the guy a lot but but he hasn't been the phils best pitcher of late."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, his era was 3rd worst in the nl when he was sent to the bullpen"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know, not sure you could say it's been THAT bad."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm sorry, but it has.  I mean, the guy at 46 just is not functioning like he did at 45.  Something about this last year..."
"__BASEBALL__ He'll always be the best to me though."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the next games will be interesting to see what shakes up with the time."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they've been pushing Pedro a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I know he got like what, 10 runs last time?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, 12."
