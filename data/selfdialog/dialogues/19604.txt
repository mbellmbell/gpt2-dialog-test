"__MOVIES__ So I saw a real cool zombie movie the other day."
"__MOVIES__ There's been a ton of them recently.  Which one."
"__MOVIES__ Remember Zombieland from a few years back?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I do.  That was a funny movie."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't realize how many stars were in it."
"__MOVIES__ Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson.."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget the younger sister who has been in about 500 movies it seems."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you mean Abagail Breslin."
"__MOVIES__ Yep.  She's been in everything."
"__MOVIES__ As for the movie itself, I thought the Bill Murray cameo was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was neat to see.  And the fact they killed him off."
"__MOVIES__ It was an accident, but it was a great way for him to poke fun at himself."
"__MOVIES__ Remember the whole part about the twinkies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, how he can't find one in the apocalypse?"
"__MOVIES__ He did at the end, but it was funny to see them find the whole van of cupcakes and him getting mad."
"__MOVIES__ You would think you would be happy to find any food really."
"__MOVIES__ That was also before Emma Stone was a bigger name."
"__MOVIES__ She would command a lot higher salary now."
"__MOVIES__ I wish they'd make a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ They've talked about it for years, but I don't think it will ever happen."
