"__ROCK__ Hey, do you know what band I've really gotten into lately?"
"__ROCK__ Which band?"
"__ROCK__ My Bloody Valentine"
"__ROCK__ Oh. I have heard of them but have always been deterred by the name"
"__ROCK__ I totally get that, but forget the name and listen. You will not regret it."
"__ROCK__ What is their sound?"
"__ROCK__ Well, they basically pioneered 'shoegaze'"
"__ROCK__ Oh, okay."
"__ROCK__ I don't usually like extra harsh sounding guitars, but their way of doing it along with Bilinda Butcher's soothing vocals make it all so beautiful"
"__ROCK__ Man, I guess I better go check them out like right now"
