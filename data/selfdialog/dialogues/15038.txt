"__ACTION__ Would you rate Dark Knight as the best action movie of all time?"
"__ACTION__ No because it was an action movie but it wasnt at the same time."
"__ACTION__ In what respect?"
"__ACTION__ You didnt NEED blowing up and fighting for that movie to be good."
"__ACTION__ So it was more of a thriller?"
"__ACTION__ It did a good job of combinging the two."
"__ACTION__ That makes it all the more fun."
"__ACTION__ Ledger acted the heck out of his role."
"__ACTION__ Bale was a great complementary piece in that one."
"__ACTION__ Its a shame they couldnt do another one since we dont know if The Joker died."
