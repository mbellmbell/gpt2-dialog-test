"__HARRY_POTTER__ I have a weird theory about Neville and Snape, I'm not sure if it makes sense though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Try me out and I'll tell you if it does."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Okay, so you know how Snape was always even more terrible than normal when it came to Neville?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, he treated him the worst, well up there with Harry at least."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, my theory is that he treats him so bad because of the prophecy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The Voldemort/Harry prophecy?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, remember, it became Harry's prophecy BECAUSE Voldemort chose him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right, he could have chosen Neville, but didn't."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, if he chose Neville instead of Harry, then Lily would still be alive presumably."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, wow, okay so he hates Neville for being alive, as he sees the prophecy and Voldemort's choice when he sees Neville. Wow."
