"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movies The Last Mimzy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was great!"
"__MOVIES__ It really went places that I had never expected."
"__MOVIES__ That's what i want in out of in a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is so refreshing and exciting when it does happen."
"__MOVIES__ Timothy Hutton is the only famous actor in it that I knew."
"__MOVIES__ Yes  that's true but isn't great they did such a good job on the trailer that it made you want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ That is true. Why is it we are always so ready to watch movies if they have one actor we know and it could be bad."
"__MOVIES__ I see where you are going with this. Why is it we are not so accepting of unknowns."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah think of some jewels we may have missed out on just because there wasn't a 'known' actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow isn't that a good metaphor for life. Not giving someone a chance because you don't know them."
"__MOVIES__ Hey  hang on I need to go check my chicken. Hah i just thought of another silly movie Ghost and Mister Chicken. Who played lead?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay I am back. Did you get the answer without looking it up?"
"__MOVIES__ I had to look it up. I remembered the name of the movie but Don Knotts was not even on my mind."
"__MOVIES__ Knott on your mind!!!  Gosh I am so lame."
"__MOVIES__ Yes you are. Barney from Andy Griffin is Don Knotts and he's not someone I think of as an 'actor'"
"__MOVIES__ more of a comedian I would say trying to act."
"__MOVIES__ Very slapstick kind of humor."
"__MOVIES__ Yes like Gilligan and Lucy."
"__MOVIES__ Yes good analogy."
