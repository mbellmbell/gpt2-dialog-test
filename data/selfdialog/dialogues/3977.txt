"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to Fiona Apple?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, is that a singer?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, a female singer. She had a very popular album about 20 years ago."
"__MUSIC__ What were some of her songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Well on her first album she had Shadowboxer, Criminal, Sleep to Dream. The entire album was fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ The song titles sound familiar. Did she play the piano?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she did. You may remember her winning a Grammy award for Criminal."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I think I know who you're talking about now. What was her first album called again?"
"__MUSIC__ Her first album was Tidal."
"__MUSIC__ That album was wildly successful right? I remember that album being a big deal with a lot of people I went to school with."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was. On top of the Grammy she won for Criminal, the album went either double or triple platinum."
"__MUSIC__ Did she ever do anything after that? I can't remember if she released music after Tidal."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, she did. Actually, interestingly enough she named her next album after a poem she wrote. It was in the Guiness Book for longest song title at the time of release I think."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I hadn't heard that. She was kind of different wasn't she?"
"__MUSIC__ She seems very creative and like she doesn't filter her self expression. I mean, she's an artist so it makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ I can remember liking that about her even though I didn't listen to her music all that often."
"__MUSIC__ I think a lot of musicians in the art pop genre are very different and expressive in ways that aren't the norm. I also like that she plays the piano beautifully and writes her own music."
"__MUSIC__ That is so cool. I thought she left the music world for awhile."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think she went on hiatus for awhile but eventually came back to record and release more music."
"__MUSIC__ I'm actually starting to remember liking her voice a lot. It was really soulful and different."
