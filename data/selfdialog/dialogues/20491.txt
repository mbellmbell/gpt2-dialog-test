"__MOVIES__ Did you see any of the movies nominated for an oscar for best picture 2017?"
"__MOVIES__ A couple of them... did you?"
"__MOVIES__ Not before the academy awards, but afterwards I saw four of them."
"__MOVIES__ So which ones did you see?"
"__MOVIES__ LaLa Land; Hidden Figures; Fences; and Lion."
"__MOVIES__ Which one did you like best?"
"__MOVIES__ Hard to say, but I think Hidden Figures."
"__MOVIES__ So why that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I like movies based on historical facts. Good narrative, interesting characters and well acted."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you think about the other three you saw?"
"__MOVIES__ They were all close to favorites. LaLa Land was just fun; Lion was really interesting, and I liked Fences but it was dark and depressing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree. I saw LaLa Land and Fences...how's that for two pretty opposite movies?"
"__MOVIES__ LOL... true enough. Are you going to see any others?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think I will see the other two you saw, since it seems like a recommendation. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ For sure I will see Arrival; and maybe Manchester by the Sea. That's it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, let me know. Maybe we can go together."
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha, I'll be renting them through NetFlix."
"__MOVIES__ Alright then, have me over to watch. I'll bring the popcorn."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I'll probably get Arrival. I think Manchester is pretty heavy and depressing."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, it's a date. Call me when you get it."
