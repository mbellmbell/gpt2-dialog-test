"__MUSIC__ Let's talk music. Who's your favorite female singer?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a favorite singer for every genre. You have to be more specific."
"__MUSIC__ I understand. I'm the same way too. I can't name a favorite song."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I have a favorite song for every emotion. They can't compete."
"__MUSIC__ So true. I need mood music. I have a favorite for every occasion."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I think it's too difficult to ask someone to choose. Well what is it?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess I mean favorite songwriter/singer? Is that easier?"
"__MUSIC__ So much easier. Thank you. Fiona Apple is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my God yes. I love her. She's awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It hurts how often she releases albums."
"__MUSIC__ They just released a vinyl copy of her 'Tidal' album. I guess I know what to get you for Christmas."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I'm so excited. I don't know if I can wait for Christmas."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think is your favorite album from her? You don't have much to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ I know. That's a hard choice buddy. Let me think about this."
"__MUSIC__ Sure. She's a master. Thank God she only has four to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ Believe me it doesn't make it easier. Each one is so good."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'll give you some time. There's 'Tidal', 'When the Pawn...', 'Extraordinary Machine', and 'The Idler Wheel...'. Pick one."
"__MUSIC__ Too hard. They're all masterpieces. They take long to come out because she puts her all in it."
"__MUSIC__ Anyone would have to give her that. She's a genius."
"__MUSIC__ She is a genius. I can't make up my mind. I think I'd have to go with 'Tidal' only because that was the start of the love affair."
