"__ROCK__ Hey, do you listen to metal?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, a fair bit. Why?"
"__ROCK__ I'm looking to get into it, but I don't know where to start. There are so many genres!"
"__ROCK__ Well, you could always start with the big four of thrash. They were my gateway into metal."
"__ROCK__ The Big Four?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer. My personal favorite is Megadeth, but many people like Metallica. They're kind of like beginner's metal."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, don't they get played on classic rock radio nowadays?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah they do, but I'd recommend their albums from the '80s. They were pretty heavy and technical back then."
"__ROCK__ Ok, I'll check them out. What else do you like?"
"__ROCK__ Lately, I've been listening to a lot of progressive metal, like Symphony X and Dream Theater."
