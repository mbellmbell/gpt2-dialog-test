"__MOVIES__ I think the movies this year so far are only mediocre. The movies last year were so much better."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I am hoping that after the summer the quality of the movies will start to improve. I am getting tired of all the action films."
"__MOVIES__ If I have to see one more Marvel superhero or Fast and Furious sequel, I will be annoyed."
"__MOVIES__ The concept that sequels are the most desirable movies is ridiculous. How many times can we see an Alien, Spiderman or Pirates of the Caribbean movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I really miss movies like Sing Street or Moonlight."
"__MOVIES__ You are so right.  I want to see a movie that has some substance and intrigues the mind."
"__MOVIES__ When I saw last year Manchester by the Sea I almost cried. The depth of the characters' personalities that were revealed was astounding."
"__MOVIES__ I loved that movie.  The experiences that the characters lived through really gripped you and created a lot of conversation."
"__MOVIES__ I also loved The Arrival. Even if it had a science fiction aspect, it still told a great story."
"__MOVIES__ I could not believe when the pods started to arrive in that movie. Amy Adams was great in the role studying the pods and trying to figure out what the creatures were saying."
"__MOVIES__ This is exactly what I'm talking about. There is depth to the story line. It is not just about blowing things up and shooting people."
"__MOVIES__ I have to say however that I did not love La La Land last year."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Why not? It was up for Best Picture at the Academy Awards?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the musical aspect of it. However, I could not believe they cast as the two main characters Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling."
"__MOVIES__ What was wrong with them? They are great actors."
"__MOVIES__ That is exactly the problem. They are great actors but they can't sing or dance."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. You have a point there. It is a musical where singing and dancing is the primary aspect of the film."
"__MOVIES__ Why could they have not cast people who can sing, dance and act?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think that makes the point that many of these movies today are made purely for economical reasons."
"__MOVIES__ You have summed up the entire problem with the current selection of movies. It is about how much money can the movie make and not the quality of the art or story."
