"__MOVIES__ My daughter thinks that Kurt Russell and Patrick Swayze look alike. Do you?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can see a resemblance because they have the same facial shape and hair color. Do you like either actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually I like both of them. They have both done a lot of great movies."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's true. Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean favorate actor or favorite movie they have starred in?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean which movies do you like best."
"__MOVIES__ I think that for Patrick Swayze it's a tie between Dirty Dancing and Ghost. Which of those do you like better?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I like Ghost best because I really like Whoopie Goldberg and Demi Moore as well as Patrick Swayze."
"__MOVIES__ I think Ghost was a funny movie but also very touching. Dirty Dancing was more serious."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. What about Kurt Russell?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked him in Overboard and also in Tombstone."
"__MOVIES__ I have never seen Overboard. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a snobby rich woman who hires a carpenter to work on her yacht."
"__MOVIES__ Who plays the rich woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Goldie Hawn of course! Anyway, after she is mean to this carpenter she falls overboard and can't remember who she is."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds funny! Is Kurt Russell the carpenter?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and he decides to get even with her and claims her as his wife. He then takes her home to take care of his awful children."
"__MOVIES__ Does she ever figure out that she isn't really his wife?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he eventually falls in love with her and tells her but she stays with him anyway."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a movie I'd like to watch."
