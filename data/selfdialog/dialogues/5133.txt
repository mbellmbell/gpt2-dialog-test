"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think of the latest Fast & Furious film?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's ok but it's getting a little ridiculous now."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you mean?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They keep going more over the top with the action."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, it's getting too unrealistic?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Basically, yes, but it's getting too far away from its roots."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You mean the car racing stuff?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, they went away from car racing and focus on heists more now."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, I liked the first film the best because it was just simple and fun."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Agreed, it used to be about fast, cool cars instead of all this other stuff."
