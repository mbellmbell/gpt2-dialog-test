"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the Hamilton Mixtape?"
"__MUSIC__ Could anything ever compete with the brilliance of the original sountrack?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not, but there's some cool new takes on the mixtape."
"__MUSIC__ I did really like the 'Immigrants We Get The Job Done' song with K'NAAN."
"__MUSIC__ And the Ashanti and Ja Rule version of 'Helpless?'"
"__MUSIC__ Going back to 2001 with that pairing."
"__MUSIC__ The Sia and Queen Latifah combo on 'Satisfied' is also brilliant."
"__MUSIC__ I guess Sia can't rap! Queen Latifah hits it out of the park, though!"
"__MUSIC__ The whole mixtape is a really eclectic group of artists. Chance the Rapper and Jimmy Fallon on the same album?"
"__MUSIC__ Jimmy Fallon's song is so hilarious! He makes for a perfect King George."
"__MUSIC__ Have you seen the original Hamilton on Broadway yet?"
"__MUSIC__ The tickets are so expensive! At this point I don't have hundreds of dollars for a Broadway show. But it'd be so worth it."
"__MUSIC__ My sister saw it earlier this year and said it will be the greatest Broadway show of all time."
"__MUSIC__ And Alexander Hamilton wasn't the most likely Broadway musical star. But his story really fits Broadway."
"__MUSIC__ I think we're also searching for our origin story as a country. What were our values? How were we made?"
"__MUSIC__ And the conflicts you see in the music are still happening in today's politics. Big government, small government?"
"__MUSIC__ Like in the rap battle between Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson?"
"__MUSIC__ And George Washington moderating?"
"__MUSIC__ What colonial revolutionary will be the star of the next Broadway hit musical?"
"__MUSIC__ Please, please let it be Dolly Madison! Heck, I'll write that show!"
