"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new Alien movie."
"__MOVIES__ Alien Covenant? How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was great!"
"__MOVIES__ What was the story line?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a more modern take.  The humans were basically destroying their own lives, so it was similar to the climate of society today."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds deep and kind of complicated."
"__MOVIES__ It really wasn't that complicated.  It was actually a simple movie, but it was made well, so it made it better."
"__MOVIES__ What did you mean by humans destroying their own lives?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the humans and aliens just want to procreate and make the world their own, so it makes a battle."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I understand.  Who is the main actor?"
"__MOVIES__ Michael Fassbender"
"__MOVIES__ Was he the actor in Assassin's Creed?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he played Aguilar in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ That was a good one too, but pretty violent."
"__MOVIES__ Well Alien: Covenant is similar. Lots of violence!"
"__MOVIES__ Did a lot of the characters die?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah most of them did, so you can't get too attached."
"__MOVIES__ That's always hard for me, but I can try."
"__MOVIES__ You definitely should; it's a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check it out."
