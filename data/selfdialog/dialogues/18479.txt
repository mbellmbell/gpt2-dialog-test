"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see a classic movie and wonder what all the fuss was about?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Totally. I felt that way when I saw Citizen Kane."
"__MOVIES__ Me too!"
"__MOVIES__ I think I might have been too young when I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I didn't get it. I read a film critics book and they said it was the best movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Right. That is what I always heard, too."
"__MOVIES__ It was not a memorable film for me. I can really only remember the last scene."
"__MOVIES__ The 'rosebud' scene."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I would be interested in going back again, with more sophistication and knowledge to see if the film means anything to me now."
"__MOVIES__ Let's do that together. We can have a little film club discussion."
"__MOVIES__ Let's do it. How old were you when you saw it?"
"__MOVIES__ Early 20's."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. I think that genius of that film is in the cinematography, maybe?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. Maybe the genius of it is in the angles and lighting, because it didn't seem like it was in the story or plot."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Let's watch it again. I would be interested in starting a film night with you to watch classic films."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great."
"__MOVIES__ At Halloween let's watch The Phantom of the Opera and Nosferatu."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Classics! And let's watch really, long difficult films that we are too lazy to watch on our own. I never even saw Gone with the Wind, can you believe it?"
"__MOVIES__ Me either! Let's watch silent films. Let's watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari together and Buster Keaton flicks."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds great. You're right. I am too lazy to watch these on my own. Some company and discussion would make it far more enticing.  I will pop the popcorn!"
