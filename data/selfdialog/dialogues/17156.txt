"__MOVIES__ Did you catch Arrival?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't recall that one. Who's in it."
"__MOVIES__ Adam Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker"
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm, still not ringing any bells."
"__MOVIES__ It deal with aliens coming to earth."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so like an invasion movie."
"__MOVIES__ No not at all, more like a mystery."
"__MOVIES__ So like War of the Worlds?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that was definitely an invasion movie. This one is much more cerebral"
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It deals with how to communicate with aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, so how do we communicate with them."
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't want to give too much away, but Adams plays a linguist that learns how to communicate with the Aliens."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, does she save the world."
"__MOVIES__ Well in some way."
"__MOVIES__ But probably not what I think"
"__MOVIES__ Right...exactly."
"__MOVIES__ And Jeremy Renner is the love interest."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, in a way."
"__MOVIES__ Always have to have the love interest."
