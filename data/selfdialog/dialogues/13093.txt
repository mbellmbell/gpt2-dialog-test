"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The fall season is months away and you know what that means"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Another season of some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right. Another season of me hoping anyone but the patriots win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can say that again. I don't think I can stomach another repeat of that last Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think there are any sleeper teams who could dethrone them this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I legitimately think that the Giants could."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Tell me more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well their defense is a top 10 defense and Brady always seems to struggle against such."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Giants' offense? They struggled mightily."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is one of the main things that makes it a huge gamble if I were a betting man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know their offensive line was bad last year, but jeez Eli looked pretty bad too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their running game could definitely use some help too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't need to be a top running team to be a threat. It just has to be a threat to the opposing defense somewhat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Any kind of running game would make their receivers even more of threat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully they do make the necessary changes. If they do then I definitely agree with what you are saying."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Odell is always a big factor as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, his mental toughness is almost non-existant"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is such an amazing receiver. All these antics need to stop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even the front office said they were tired of it and that he needs to mature."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does or else he is going to end up being the next Terrell Owens and universally hated and ringless."
