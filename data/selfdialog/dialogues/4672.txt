"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the soundtrack to the series Peaky Blinders? I hear there is a lot of good music attached to that show."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I have and yes, there is. There is a lot of British bands of course."
"__MUSIC__ Like who? I'm bad with names."
"__MUSIC__ Nick Cage does a lot of their music. 'Abattoir's Blues, Marth's Deam, The Boatman's Call' are all really cool. Kind of haunting."
"__MUSIC__ That kind of sounds familiar. Who else?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the Weepies? They did quite a few."
"__MUSIC__ I know about them. 'Nobody Knows Me At All' is great. I also like 'Somebody Loved.'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm pretty sure both of those have played on there. What about Tom Waits's 'Time?'"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds about right. He has that kind of gravelly voice."
"__MUSIC__ I think PJ Harvey, The Sapphires, and Queenies did some songs too. I'm sure I'm missing more."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, for a drama they seem to have a lot of music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they do but it is all so perfectly timed."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to have to watch it and listen carefully."
"__MUSIC__ I think one of the most amazing things is how they blended contemporary music with old time period and it seems seamless."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool but if you choose the right music....it can be timeless."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. The Soldier's Minute and Red Right Hand are really good."
"__MUSIC__ I look forward to hearing that music. What category do you think that music is?"
"__MUSIC__ Good question, rock maybe?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I was thinking. I'm going to see what I can find."
"__MUSIC__ If you find more, be sure to share. I am always looking for new music."
