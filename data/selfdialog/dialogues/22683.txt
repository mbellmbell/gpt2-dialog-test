"__DISNEY__ Are you going to see Cars 3 this summer?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I don't think so. Are you going to see it?"
"__DISNEY__ I might. I think the graphics look awesome."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I agree the graphics do look cool. I just think they need to be done with the Cars movies."
"__DISNEY__ I'm willing to give Cars 3 a chance. Toy Story 3 ended up being one of the best movies, so maybe this will be okay."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Toy Story 2 was also good. Cars 2 wasn't that great."
"__DISNEY__ I'm thinking maybe Pixar and Disney learned from their mistakes in the second Cars movie."
"__DISNEY__ I hope so, otherwise Cars 3 will be even worse than Cars 2."
"__DISNEY__ I bet Disney doesn't care though. The franchise is probably meant for kids who don't care much about the plot anyways."
"__DISNEY__ You're probably right about that."
