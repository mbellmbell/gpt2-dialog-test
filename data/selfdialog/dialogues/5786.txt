"__STAR_WARS__ It's hard to believe that Star Wars is a 40-year-old franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is it really?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The original Star Wars came out in 1977. They had a 40th anniversary celebration this year."
"__STAR_WARS__ It seems like it's such a timeless franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they update it when new installments come out."
"__STAR_WARS__ That can age movies, though. The CGI in the prequel trilogy really stands out."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope the use of practical effects in The Force Awakens avoids that."
"__STAR_WARS__ J J Abrams is a good filmmaker. He respects more the aesthetic of the original."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. The setting's 'used universe' feel is very important."
"__STAR_WARS__ And it was definitely there in The Force Awakens, and in Rogue One."
