"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think will be the NFL's top rookie this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's tough to say. After all, who thought Dak prescott would do anything at this time last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but I have to think Leonard Fournette will do great things in Jacksonville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's probably right. They'll lean heavily on him with Blake Bortles being so mediocre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will. And Christian McCaffrey should put up some good numbers in Carolina."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, as a runner and receiver, he should get a lot of touches from Cam Newton this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. And while QBs are hard to predict, I have to think Deshaun Watson will put up some good numbers in Houston."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they were a mediocre division winner last year, but they were a winner, and joning a winner is always easier for a rookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has to beat out Tom Savage, but that shouldn't be hard."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, and he brings a level of mobility there they've never had at quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dalvin Cook should get a lot of touches in Minnesota."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Vikings thought enough of him to unload Adrian Peterson, so that's probably right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And what about run-stoppers? Myles Garrett was the top overall pick, and he should help Cleveland's defense improve immediately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but the rest of that defense is so bad it may overshadow him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haason Reddick joins a decent Arizona defense and should make their linebacking corps a lot better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same could be said for Malik Hooker, anthough he comes into a Colts secondary that got beat up last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jamal Adams may be a better safety, but he comes into an even worse situation with the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they may get torched so much this year his play will be rendered moot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't rule out Derek Barnett, either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the Eagles weren't horrible last year, and with him at defensive end they can only get better."
