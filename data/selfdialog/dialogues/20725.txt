"__THRILLER__ Yea! That movie freaked me out."
"__THRILLER__ Me too! It was based on a true story."
"__THRILLER__ Yea, but didn't they survive in real life?"
"__THRILLER__ I'm not sure. At least one of them did."
"__THRILLER__ Still, That's crazy to get left out in shark infested water like that."
"__THRILLER__ I know, I didn't blame the girl for giving up at the end."
"__THRILLER__ I would have done it much sooner."
"__THRILLER__ Could you imagine being out in the Ocean at night all alone, just waiting to get eaten?"
"__THRILLER__ No, that's literally my worst nightmare."
