"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like the music of Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I kind of do, but she is a bit on the wild side for my taste."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I agree, the shows and her stage presence, and even publicity stunts do seem a bit wild.  But she has so many great songs!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I never thought much about it.  What songs are you talking about?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, she has a lot of big hits, but one of my favorite songs she does is 'You and I'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I didn't know she did that song.  It's more of a rock ballad type song.  I really do like it when it comes up on the radio!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She has so many hits, like 'Poker Face'  'Bad Romance' and 'Born This Way'"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh wow, that music video for Born This Way is kinda scary and weird.  But the song is good"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think that song, 'Born This Way'  is her most powerful song with a message.  Although, most of her songs have a message of some sort."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That"
