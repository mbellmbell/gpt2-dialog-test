"__MUSIC__ Hey, so I listened to that band you recommended the other day."
"__MUSIC__ You mean Periphery?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__MUSIC__ So did you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man, I listened to a few of their songs and they were pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome man!"
"__MUSIC__ They are really technical though!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they do a lot of intricate guitar work in their songs.  And I don't know much about drums but even I can tell it's hard."
"__MUSIC__ But they are really good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I love them."
"__MUSIC__ I also started listening to August Burns Red again."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  What songs are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I downloaded their newest album and I'm hooked on the song Martyr."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's a good one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've already listened to it like four times today."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I do the same thing where I listen to a song like crazy when I first hear it."
"__MUSIC__ And that song is so good!  I love the guitar as it fades out at the end."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I really like that too."
"__MUSIC__ Not as many bands do that anymore.  I like it because the song hangs around a little longer and you don't have to say goodbye right away."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it is kind of like that."
