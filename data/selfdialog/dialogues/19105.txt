"__MOVIES__ Have you gotten a chance to see Deadpool?"
"__MOVIES__ No I havent gotten to see it yet, how was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure it was the greatest comic book movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Of all time?  That's kind of bold."
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty hard to top, the humor in it was pretty great and it had a great story."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it a bit graphic?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, that's kind of the point though."
"__MOVIES__ How do you figure?"
"__MOVIES__ Comic movies have always been PG-13, this is one of the rare cases that they took a chance on making it rated R."
"__MOVIES__ Why does that matter?"
"__MOVIES__ It means the film industry is willing to give it a shot.  If Deadpool does extremely well you're bound to see more movies come out rated R."
"__MOVIES__ That would be great."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, in fact I think they already have one scheduled because of how well Deadpool is doing."
"__MOVIES__ Who is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's about Wolverine."
"__MOVIES__ Wolverine?  Now a rated R Wolverine movie would be awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I think they are doing it in the future."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, they are doing old man Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea that's what I heard."
"__MOVIES__ I am so excited to see Deadpool now."
