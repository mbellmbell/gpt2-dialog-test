"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new Mummy movie."
"__MOVIES__ With Tom Cruise?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, for whatever reason, he is in it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It made no sense."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the old ones were great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, I seen all of them."
"__MOVIES__ The new ones chose an aging actor."
"__MOVIES__ So, he is still a good actor."
"__MOVIES__ Not in this film."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ He just runs around. There is a mummy, no real plot."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it would have been a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ There is a lot of action, if you are into that."
"__MOVIES__ I like action films and Tom Cruise, I am sure I might still like it."
"__MOVIES__ There is no plot, at all. I could barely follow what was going on."
"__MOVIES__ Was there at least a good villain?"
"__MOVIES__ The only thing scary about the mummy, was the fact their eyes looked like snakes."
