"__DISNEY__ Have you sen the new Cars movie yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No I haven't, but I can't wait to see it!"
"__DISNEY__ It looks really good, Lightening McQueen has a new rival."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think they're going to have more of Mater in it?"
"__DISNEY__ I think I saw Mater in the preview."
"__DISNEY__ My kids think Mater is the best part of the movies."
"__DISNEY__ Mater is funny, but I don't think he was that special."
"__DISNEY__ Well, obviously a lot of people liked Mater because Cars 2 was mostly just about him!"
"__DISNEY__ That's true. The new one is supposed to be about Lightening McQueen and a new character named Cruz."
"__DISNEY__ Is Cruz supposed to be his new rival?"
