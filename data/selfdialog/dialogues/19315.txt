"__MOVIES__ In this day and age, I think superhero movies have become rapidly popular. Who is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I am a huge Batman fan and I think in terms of film, he is at the very top!"
"__MOVIES__ I cannot disagree with that one bit. Batman has had many movies made, from animation to live action. What is your favorite animated Batman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I think Mask of the Phantasm was the best. It was just an amazing story."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that one very well, and I can't disagree one bit. I loved the story and the struggle."
"__MOVIES__ It was an amazing story and we also got to see Batman's origin in the eyes of the animated series world."
"__MOVIES__ That is true. We as fans, go to see him put on the gear for the very first time. Truly an amazing scene."
"__MOVIES__ I think Alfred's reaction, the score, and Batman not saying a single word made that scene probably the best of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Another good thing about Mask of the Phantasm is The Joker is also a primary role. Do you that was needed?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and no. While I am always up for hearing Mark Hamill's Joker, and didn't mind in this movie, I do not think it was a total must-have."
"__MOVIES__ It felt like towards the end, of the identity of the Phantasm was revealed, and we had Batman chasing Joker, it almost felt like another episode of the series."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. But that did not make it any less enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not. I think Mark Hamill did some amazing voice work in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was another very intense fight scene between the two. And Batman saying 'Whatever it takes!' was also pretty strong."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think Batman meant by that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think he meant he was willing to do whatever it took to stop Joker from inflecting as much pain as he has to Batman and the woman he loved."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good way to look at it. One thing about that movie is do you think it's meant to be a part of the animated series world?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it did. Even though the Phantasm was never mentioned again in the series, the story is that Joker was able to escape her at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that makes sense. That also explains how he is able to still be around for so long in that world."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. Either way we look at, when it comes to general Batman movies, mask of the Phantasm is one of the best!"
