"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie The Intern?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Google?"
"__MOVIES__ No, no this has Anne Hathaway and Robert de Niro."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes I loved that movie! What was your favorite part?"
"__MOVIES__ I really loved that it showed a woman in charge of a booming business."
"__MOVIES__ I know that seemed very refreshing."
"__MOVIES__ I also think that Ann Hathaway did a great job of capturing a woman in a high stress situation like that and balancing her home life and being a mother."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree! That was also a refreshing touch."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you really don't see a lot of movies with woman who run businesses and have families."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. Not to mention this movie was so funny!"
"__MOVIES__ I know they did such a great job mixing in drama with comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah well you know I am a big fan of Adam DeVine so I knew this movie would have a great funny undertone."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he did do a great job and I am glad he is branching out and doing so many movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah did you see that other movie he was in, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I did but I have to say I was kind of disappointed. They made it seem like it was going to be so funny and it fell short for me."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I agree. I just loved the cast so I would probably watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ Well I won't be watching that with you but if you would want to watch The Intern later today I would be into that."
"__MOVIES__ Okay yeah that sounds great. Or I know two movie passes if you want to see something else?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Lets go see that knew Alien movie. I haven't seen a great SiFy movie in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. Lets go there is a showing a 3PM today."
