"__STAR_WARS__ You know, I didn't believe it at first, when Vader claimed to be Luke's father."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does come a bit out of left field, doesn't it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly.  The first movie was written as if Darth and Annakin were separate characters. The revelation in Empire Strikes Back doesn't match what came before."
"__STAR_WARS__ It does, however, match the Degobah cave scene.  It was foreshadowing."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was weak foreshadowing, though.   Lucas really should have put in some more info about Darth and Anakin."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it's effective the way it is."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't.  I think that it's the kind of thing the audience will disbelieve."
"__STAR_WARS__ You'd need to do a study.  All you'd need to do is find 500 people who don't know that Vader is Luke's father, and show them the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that would be impossible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I'm sure of it.   It's too well know. You could try, though."
