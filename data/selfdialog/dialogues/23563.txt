"__DISNEY__ I watched the Lion King the other day.  But I still don't see how it is Hamlet."
"__DISNEY__ Well, the uncle kills the king and takes his place."
"__DISNEY__ I get that.  But nothing else about it is the same."
"__DISNEY__ That's true.  Like Simba ran away after his dad was killed, not before."
"__DISNEY__ And most of the characters were still alive in the end."
"__DISNEY__ Timon and Pumbaa were like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, right?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so.  But they did not try to help Simba get executed."
"__DISNEY__ And Simba didn't have them killed either."
"__DISNEY__ In short, I wish people would say that The Lion King was influenced by Hamlet, not that it's the exact same story."
"__DISNEY__ But the movie is still good.  And Jonathan Taylor Thomas had the perfect voice for child Simba."
