"__DISNEY__ Who do you think makes the best movies in the movie industry?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely Disney, hands down."
"__DISNEY__ Why's that?"
"__DISNEY__ They just have so much range at this point. They started out with hand-drawn cartoons, then added live action, and now they have animation too."
"__DISNEY__ They bought Marvel too, so they're in charge of all the superhero films pretty much."
"__DISNEY__ Yep, every superhero except the DC Universe ones, which is pretty much just Batman and Superman."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't they buy another entity as well?"
"__DISNEY__ Yea they bought that Star Wars franchise."
"__DISNEY__ Oh wow, that probably cost them a ton of money."
"__DISNEY__ Probably, but it's definitely worth it. The new Star Wars movies are going to make them billions of dollars."
