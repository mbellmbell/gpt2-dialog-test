"__DISNEY__ Did you see the cool movie Zootopia?"
"__DISNEY__ The one about fox and rabbit?"
"__DISNEY__ It's about an utopia for animals."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, sort of a reflection of humans."
"__DISNEY__ What do you think? Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure, it was very interesting. It reminds me of New York City."
"__DISNEY__ Is that where you're from? New York?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, just like Zootopia."
"__DISNEY__ I am from San Francisco. That's another Zootopia."
"__DISNEY__ Sure. Do you remember the sloth? I think that's the best part."
