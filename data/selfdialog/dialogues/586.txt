"__MUSIC__ What do you think about the music of today?"
"__MUSIC__ Even though I'm fifty, I really still love all of the new stuff that's coming out."
"__MUSIC__ Really? What type of music do you currently listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I have those commercial free stations in my jeep, so I tend to tune into the top 40 channels."
"__MUSIC__ Nice! I think I could get used to listening to music that way."
"__MUSIC__ It is nice. I don't like commercials, but I do love music."
"__MUSIC__ So who are some of your favorite newer artists?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Bruno Mars. He's got moves and style."
"__MUSIC__ I do too! I like Justin Beber too, but don't tell anyone!"
"__MUSIC__ That's funny! My grandson liked him until he turned about 7 and the world started influencing his choices."
"__MUSIC__ I don't let anyone dictate to me what I can listen to musically, but I don't need that judgement either."
"__MUSIC__ No one does."
"__MUSIC__ Can you think of any other great newer artists?"
"__MUSIC__ I can think of some. I can't say they're all awesome though. Arianna Grande comes to mind."
"__MUSIC__ She's got a good voice. But I find her a little bit too sexy for her age."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly what I was thinking."
"__MUSIC__ Not much different from how Britney Spears started out though. I guess it's a pattern."
"__MUSIC__ Tried and true. As long as the music is good, I will listen."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Music is music, as long as it's good."
"__MUSIC__ I like to think of music as a time out for my soul. So if I'm listening to it, it better be good."
