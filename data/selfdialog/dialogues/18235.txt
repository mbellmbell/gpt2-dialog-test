"__MOVIES__ Isn't it really exciting when TV shows make the jump to the big screen with movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it really is."
"__MOVIES__ Like when The Simpsons Movie came out, that was really kind of an event."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think anyone thought it would actually happen until it really did."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, or to use a smaller example, when Aqua Teen Hunger Force released the Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film For Theaters."
"__MOVIES__ That title is a mouthful!"
"__MOVIES__ That's part of the joke. The DVD release had an even longer title."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you can't say that their humor isn't irreverent!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but my point was, even though it's kind of silly it's hard to not get excited when you see a show you like become a movie!"
"__MOVIES__ What about when old TV shows are remade as movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Like 21 Jump Street?"
"__MOVIES__ Something like that, yeah."
"__MOVIES__ That's a little bit different, since the show has been off the air for so long. It's not a direct continuation."
"__MOVIES__ I guess the Reno 911 movie would be a better example, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's more what I'm talking about. It doesn't seem like it happens often, though."
"__MOVIES__ It's probably really hard to translate what works on the smaller screen onto the silver screen."
"__MOVIES__ I imagine you're right. That's probably why we end up with lots of reboots instead."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it makes sense. If it worked as a movie once, it could work again."
"__MOVIES__ Like the three different versions of The Thing!"
"__MOVIES__ Or even better, the dozen different King Kong movies they've done."
