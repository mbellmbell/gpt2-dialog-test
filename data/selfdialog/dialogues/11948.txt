"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, when's the NFL season start?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The season opener is September 7th!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Awesome, I'm so excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same, who do you think is gonna win MVP?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tough to say, if I had to guess I would say Tom Brady"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he should too, but they hold him to a higher standard"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know what you mean. He really has to limit his mistakes if he wants to win it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and if any other QB has a really good year they'll lean towards him"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kinda like coach of the year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Belichick is definitely the best coach but they never give him the award"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it normally goes to a coach with a decent roster that makes playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or a team that gets a lot of injuries and still plays well"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about rookie of the year, who's gonna win that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's gotta be Myles Garrett"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I think it's gonna be Christian McCaffrey"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's gonna get a lot of opportunities to make big plays"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the Panther's offensive line is so bad"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he can catch passes too"
