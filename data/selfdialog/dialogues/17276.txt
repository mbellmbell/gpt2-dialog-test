"__MOVIES__ What was the most disgusting movie you've ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, this is an interesting topic."
"__MOVIES__ Not what you expected?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really what I'd like to talk about."
"__MOVIES__ You must have something in mind."
"__MOVIES__ I do.  For me, Pink Flamingos."
"__MOVIES__ Solid choice, but not the right one."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, smart guy, what would you say?"
"__MOVIES__ The Human Centipede."
"__MOVIES__ Hard to argue that one."
"__MOVIES__ Pink Flamingos is only disgusting because of the end."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah, that was disgusting, but there was more than that."
"__MOVIES__ Human Centipede was non-stop disgusting all the way."
"__MOVIES__ The very point of the movie is just crazy."
"__MOVIES__ It makes you wonder how these films even get made."
"__MOVIES__ Anything gets made if you've got a producer willing to fork over cash."
"__MOVIES__ That aside, who even thinks of this stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Very twisted individuals in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, they made a few Human Centipedes by the way."
"__MOVIES__ Don't remind me.  Makes my heart drop a bit."
