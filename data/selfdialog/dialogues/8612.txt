"__BEATLES__ Who is your favorite Beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ Ringo, obviously!"
"__BEATLES__ Wait, seriously? Or are you joking?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm joking - although I do love Ringo."
"__BEATLES__ So who's your favorite then?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm going to be a contrarian and go with George Harrison, what about you?"
"__BEATLES__ Ah George - so underrated, I think I'd have to say Paul McCartney."
"__BEATLES__ I can understand that - Hey Jude and Let it Be are two of  my favorites!"
"__BEATLES__ And Here Comes the Sun and While My Guitar Gently Weeps are Two of mine!"
"__BEATLES__ Well then I guess we agree for the most part."
