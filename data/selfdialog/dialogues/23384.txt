"__DISNEY__ I have to admit something to you."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah. Confess away!"
"__DISNEY__ You know how I constantly make Bambi jokes. I've never seen Bambi!"
"__DISNEY__ Your secret is safe with me. Your jokes always made sense so I never questioned it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh good! I'm glad it wasn't obvious that I hadn't seen it."
"__DISNEY__ It definitely wasn't obvious. I do the same thing with a few Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Really, what do you do?"
"__DISNEY__ I always make jokes about the spaghetti kissing scene in Lady and the Tramp."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! But I actually saw that movie."
"__DISNEY__ I've seen a clip of that part. I think it'd be much messier in person."
