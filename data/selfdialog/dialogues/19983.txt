"__MOVIES__ Do you remember when Martin Scorsese finally won a Best Picture"
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't it for Gangs of New York?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that was nominated, but didn't win."
"__MOVIES__ So which one finally won?"
"__MOVIES__ The Departed"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I remember that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really liked it."
"__MOVIES__ Quite the story line with all the double-crossing"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Matt Damon was the biggest rat of them all"
"__MOVIES__ But Mark Wahlberg finally gets him in the end."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was a classic scene."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked Leo's work in that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, agree. He did a really good job."
"__MOVIES__ And then Alec Baldwin had a nice supporting role in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I thought he was pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ I really didn't like Jack Nicholson in it though."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. The accent was horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the way he finally died was a bit much."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well you can't win them all."
"__MOVIES__ No you certainly cannot."
