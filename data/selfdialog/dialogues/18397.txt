"__MOVIES__ Out of the all three of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, which one do you feel was the strongest?"
"__MOVIES__ By far, I'd have to go with The Dark Knight from 2008. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree, honestly. Heath Ledger's Joker completely blow people away, in my opinion, and stole the show."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, definitely. I can remember reading the negative feedback online feedback when he was announced to play the role."
"__MOVIES__ Same here, and I too went it to the movie back in 2008 pretty skeptical."
"__MOVIES__ Did your mindset change at all after seeing the first teaser and hearing his infamous laugh for the first time?"
"__MOVIES__ Honestly, no, not really. It wasn't until the very first actual trailer, where we got to actually see his Joker, when I really warmed up."
"__MOVIES__ I'll buy that, since I can't help but agree. That first trailer was simply amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Thinking of the Joker specifically, what do you think was his best scene in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Very good question. As far as a general performance standpoint, I loved the scene at the jailhouse where Batman integrates him."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that scene is definitely up there for me, as well."
"__MOVIES__ I feel as if that was the scene where Heath Ledger really captured The Joker."
"__MOVIES__ Once again, you make another valid point. Batman just beating on him and Joker sadistically laughing was great storytelling."
"__MOVIES__ Not just that, but Heath Ledger's acting was also completely on point. Just an amazing scene."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Does any other Joker scene standout to you from the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I also loved the part where he crashes the party and tells Rachel his story of his wife. Another amazing acting performance."
"__MOVIES__ Yes! That scene also stood out to me quite a bit and there is also a fair amount of humor in it, as well."
"__MOVIES__ That's what helped make Ledger's Joker so amazing. He thru in some humor on top of the psychotic Joker character."
"__MOVIES__ So, you feel he surly earned his Oscar?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. He did amazing things for that character."
