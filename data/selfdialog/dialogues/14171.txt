"__HORROR__ Do you remember that movie with Eliza Dushku in it about 15 years ago?"
"__HORROR__ Was it the one where they were camping?  Pretty sure the name is Wrong Turn."
"__HORROR__ I remember now.  That was such a great movie.  I wished the sequels were as good as the original."
"__HORROR__ They never are.  The ending was my favorite part when they came back to the convenience store to rip down the map."
"__HORROR__ That was funny.  I was really sad when the boyfriend was hit with all the arrows."
"__HORROR__ That was upsetting.  He almost made it back to the truck, but the killers were just too good at hunting."
"__HORROR__ How about the part with the ranger station in the trees?  Would you have jumped out of it?"
"__HORROR__ I would definitely have jumped because it was on fire."
"__HORROR__ I can tell you this, I did not want ot take a camping trip to the mountains anytime soon after seeing that movie."
"__HORROR__ Just don't take any unmarked roads and you'll be fine."
