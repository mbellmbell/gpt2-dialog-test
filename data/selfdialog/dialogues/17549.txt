"__MOVIES__ At our weekly lunches we've been talking about movies."
"__MOVIES__ Right."
"__MOVIES__ And your favorite is Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
"__MOVIES__ Right again."
"__MOVIES__ And you like The Graduate, Forrest Gump, and Fiddler on the Roof."
"__MOVIES__ Where are you going with this?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, do you like any movies from this century?"
"__MOVIES__ Very funny.  But we've talked about some recent movies."
"__MOVIES__ O.K., well give me one recent movie that isn't well known that you would like me to see."
"__MOVIES__ O.K., Brooklyn"
"__MOVIES__ That movies is known--it was nominated for an academy award."
"__MOVIES__ O.K. then--what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ New York."
"__MOVIES__ You've proved my point, a good movie not widely known."
"__MOVIES__ Well, tell me what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a simple movie about an Irish girl who comes to America and the adjustments she must make."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't sound very exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Well there aren't car chases, but the actress, someone named Ronan I believe, is wonderful, and there is the conflict between her being Irish and her Italian boyfriend."
"__MOVIES__ There must be more."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the main drama comes when she's called back to Ireland and must decide between an Irish suitor and her boyfriend in America.  I won't spoil the ending for you."
