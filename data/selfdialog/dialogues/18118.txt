"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen a movie called The Thing with Kurt Russell?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I have and incredibly I didn't see it for the first time until 2 years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Really?! It's a classic, one of the best horror movies ever."
"__MOVIES__ I know that's why I'm surprised I hadn't seen it before then."
"__MOVIES__ Kurt Russell was good in that. I also loved him in Overboard and Big Trouble in Little China."
"__MOVIES__ Classic 80s flicks. That was the best time for movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know. They were innocent but at the same time not."
"__MOVIES__ Kurt Russell came back after a while when Tarantino put him in Death Proof."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah I saw that. It was definitely classic Tarantino style."
"__MOVIES__ Right and now that I'm thinking of Goldie Hawn, I just saw her in Snatched."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right, the one where her and her daughter get kidnapped on vacation."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that was hilarious. There's a tapeworm scene in there that made me squirm all over the place."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yuck! Yes I could barely handle that. I had to cover my eyes and look away from the screen."
"__MOVIES__ There's a movie called How to be a Latin Lover that I think is going to be funny."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen a trailer for that one. Have you seen the new Alien yet, Alien Covenant?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't seen it but I heard the reviews were bad."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that too but I don't like listening to reviews. I don't always like what the mainstream does."
"__MOVIES__ Right. And Prometheus was great, that was the prequel for the Alien franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's a great example. They trashed that one but I absolutely love it."
"__MOVIES__ I love sc-fi movies in general. The Fourth Kind is one of my favorites."
