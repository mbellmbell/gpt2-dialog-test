"__POP__ Who do you think the best pop star of all time is?"

"__POP__ How about Michael Jackson?"
"__POP__ Michael Jackson is a legend, but for the younger generations I believe Beyonce is the queen."
"__POP__ Michael Jackson has been a pop fixture since his early days in the Jackson 5.  People still sing the song 'I'll be there' even though it is decades old."
"__POP__ That's true.  His songs will be played for a long time."
"__POP__ I don't want to take anything away from Beyonce.  She is very talented."
