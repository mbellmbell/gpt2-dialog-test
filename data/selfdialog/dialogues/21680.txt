"__DISNEY__ I heard they are going to make a live-action Lion King movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh not another one those!"
"__DISNEY__ What, you aren't a big fan of those live action remakes?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know... every time I watch them I prefer the original ones, not to discredit the films."
"__DISNEY__ Well I heard they are going to reprise the voice actor for Mufasa!"
"__DISNEY__ Ok, that does sound pretty cool! What about the songs?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not too sure, the original ones are so iconic, I dont think the studios would want to mess that up!"
"__DISNEY__ They had them in the new Beauty and the Beast adaptation?"
"__DISNEY__ Yah those songs were fine but they just don't speak to me like the original."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, maybe thisi adaptation will do something different."
