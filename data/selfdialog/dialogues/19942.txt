"__MOVIES__ I have Comcast cable tv, and I love their OnDemand where you can watch all kinds of tv shows and movies for free."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of free movies do you like to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I like watching all the old movies on TCM, Turner Classic Movies."
"__MOVIES__ I like TCM because there are a lot of great old movies people wouldn't be able to see anymore without that channel."
"__MOVIES__ My daughter and son-in-law live with me, so I have to watch a LOT of movies they like."
"__MOVIES__ Everybody likes different kinds of movies, so I bet it's things you wouldn't normally watch."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not into vampires and scary stuff. But my daughter LOVES the Twilight movies series. They have all five movies up on OnDemand right now until October."
"__MOVIES__ Uh oh. So you're getting a Twilight overload?"
"__MOVIES__ I already have for years because she has the dvds. I can't even count how many times I've watched a Twilight movie, over a hundred I'm sure."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, she really loves Twilight huh?"
"__MOVIES__ She watches the dvds, on OnDemand, and on the cable tv channels whenever it's on. Her and my son-in-law sit and quote the lines before the characters even say them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh how funny. They must really enjoy it."
"__MOVIES__ They laugh hysterically when they do it. She will say something like Bella's line, 'How long have you been seventeen?' and then my son-in-law will say Edward's line. 'A while,' and then they will both giggle."
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of cute that they have that much fun with it."
"__MOVIES__ My daughter fell in love with Twilight reading the books so much, that for years she has been talking about how much she wants to move to Washington state where the movie was shot."
"__MOVIES__ Why hasn't she moved?"
"__MOVIES__ She can't afford it, thank God. I wouldn't want her to leave since she is my only child, but I don't want to move to Washington."
"__MOVIES__ Why not? I heard it's a pretty state, with nice weather."
"__MOVIES__ It's full of trees, and I have allergies. And I keep telling her all the serial killers go to Washington."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately, serial killers seem to live all over the US nowadays. But I can see what you mean about the trees and allergies."
