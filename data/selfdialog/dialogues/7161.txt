"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you listened to (Gaga's new-ish album) Joanne yet?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, but I like the singles I've heard so far. Anything that takes us away from the memory of Artpopâ€¦"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh my goodness, I know, right? She even had the sense to keep it out of that halftime show."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I hope she's realized its best to leave all of that era in the past. She went full Art School Kid and it was bad."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Very very cringey. This Joanne phase seems to be a lot more grounded. I'm not sure I understand the hats but I I ever understand her hats?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Ha, fair point. At least she's stopped referring to hats as vital organs. 'asking me to remove my hat is like asking me to remove my liver' Oh please."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Back to the music, cause if we stick with the fashion, we'll just be confused, I like the genre shift in Joanne and Cheek To Cheek to less dancehall and more, everything else. She's best with a simple backing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes yes yes. Keep it simple! She's got the voice and the talent. Not everything has to be remixed with 12 guests and a yak."
"__LADY_GAGA__ A yaaaaaaaak! She would. You know that's gonna be the midlife crisis Madonna phase: yak music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ And yet, it will sell and we'll all dance to it. Gaga is a witch."
