"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie Black Water?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've never heard of it. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a giant killer crocodile."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, one of those movies. No, I think those movies are boring."
"__MOVIES__ Not this one! Two women get stuck out in the middle of a swamp and their boat is just a few feet away from them, but they can't get to it."
"__MOVIES__ So what do they do?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, they try to come up with different ways of getting to the boat, but every time they try, the crocodile shows up again."
"__MOVIES__ Man, that sounds really cheesy."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it is, but it still does a great job of capturing the fear."
"__MOVIES__ The fear of getting eaten by a crocodile?"
"__MOVIES__ Well that yes, but mostly that fear of the unknown."
"__MOVIES__ What's unknown, they know what the crocodile is going to do."
"__MOVIES__ Yea but they can't see the crocodile. They don't even know if it's still there."
"__MOVIES__ So what? They still know it's a crocodile."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, but for all they know, the crocodile left a long time, and they are just staying up there for no reason."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see what you mean. They might be starving themselves just out of fear."
"__MOVIES__ Right, the fear of the unknown."
"__MOVIES__ Gotcha. That is kind of cool."
"__MOVIES__ See? It's not a bad movie, you should check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will."
