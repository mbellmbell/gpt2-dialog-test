"__DISNEY__ What Disney movie has made you the saddest?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably The Lion King. I saw it when I was really little."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. It was definitely sad when Mufasa died!"
"__DISNEY__ I felt so bad for poor, sweet Simba."
"__DISNEY__ It wasn't all sad though, it was funny when he was with Timon and Pumbaa."
"__DISNEY__ They were so hilarious. I love 'Hakuna Matata,' too."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite scene is when Simba sings 'I Just Can't Wait to be King.'"
"__DISNEY__ He is being sort of obnoxious during that song, but it is adorable!"
"__DISNEY__ And Zazu's bickering at him makes it even funnier."
"__DISNEY__ Even though it is a sad movie, I still love a lot of it, and it definitely has funny parts!"
