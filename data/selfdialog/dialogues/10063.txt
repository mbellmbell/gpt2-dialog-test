"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What rap song do you know every single word to?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh man, Afroman's Palmdale. I would like sit at home and play that song for hours."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Never heard of it, all I know is that song Because I Got High."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ha, that's a good one too. 'I was gonna clean my room, but then I got high.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think I for sure know every single lyric to Jay-Z's 99 Problems."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think I do too! That song is such a classic, I feel like probably everyone has heard of it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ For real. But you know what? I don't really listen to that much Jay-Z."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Me neither actually. I think most of the time I hear him featured on one of Kanye's songs or something."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You're right. The last song I heard by him was Shining, but that was on DJ Khaled's new album and it featured Beyoncé."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh I will listen to anything featuring Beyoncé."
