"__STAR_WARS__ I was reading the other day that Yoda's toes change."
"__STAR_WARS__ Toes change?  That makes no sense."
"__STAR_WARS__ Let me explain more.  Depending on the movie you're watching, the number of toes he has changes."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's a very interesting fact."
"__STAR_WARS__ Guess how many toes he has in Phantom Menace"
"__STAR_WARS__ Two?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Three actually.  Guess how many in all the other movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Four?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Correct!  Apparently it was a change for when they redeveloped the costume suit."
"__STAR_WARS__ You would have thought they would have kept it the same for continuity purposes."
