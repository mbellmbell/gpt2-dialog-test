"__MOVIES__ You're a huge horror movie fan aren't you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, I watch every horror movie that comes out!"
"__MOVIES__ What would be your favorite horror movie"
"__MOVIES__ It's between The Ring, and Dead Alive"
"__MOVIES__ You can't pick just one?"
"__MOVIES__ It's hard. They are just so different!"
"__MOVIES__ OK, well tell me about both of them."
"__MOVIES__ The ring is a straignt up horrow movie!"
"__MOVIES__ How scary is it really though?"
"__MOVIES__ I was watching the Excorcist when I was seven years old, so I've seen a lot of scary movies......."
"__MOVIES__ The Excorcist, really? I still can't watch that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, The Ring is the only horror movie that ever bothered me afterwards."
"__MOVIES__ How did it bother you?"
"__MOVIES__ For the longest time, if I walked past a TV in the dark, I was terrified that it would turn on all by itself."
"__MOVIES__ Why were you afraid of that?"
"__MOVIES__ That how the little girl in the movie kills you. She crawls out of the TV."
"__MOVIES__ Really? The TV? Ok what about Dead Alive?"
"__MOVIES__ Dead Alive was made in New Zealand by Peter Jackson, it was his first movie."
"__MOVIES__ Was it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, it was more gory than anything I'v ever seen before, but it was also the funniest movie I've ever seen!"
