"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey Brandon how's it going?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Going well Dan just watching some old foozeball games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ahh cool me and my uncle used to watch the old Superbowls too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm watching some old Patriots videos, I never realized Tom Brady has been playing since the 90s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is truly remarkable, and his arm hasn't ever looked better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy is stud with an incredible team at his back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely agree man, and with Gronkowski coming back from injury they should stay solid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I completely forgot about Gronk, he's really coming back from injury?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah man, it was bad, and it seems like forever since he played."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember last year they went 17-2 without him which is just insane on it's own."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bellicheck and Brady can handle the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure, but it's just child play for them now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ These guys are getting older, and the younger teams seem to be really hungry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true, but fear an old man in a place where men die young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a strange analogy, but I kind of understand."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just dog eat dog out there, and the wisest players are the most experienced."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are right, that experience and intelligence has carried the Patriots through a lot of wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You want to watch some more film with me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure I could watch and talk football all day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Take a seat and grab a beer bud!"
