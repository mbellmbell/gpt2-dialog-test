"__BEATLES__ The Beatles used to be my favorite group."
"__BEATLES__ How old are you--I hardly know any of their songs, they're so long ago."
"__BEATLES__ Yeh, probably the greatest group of all time and you don't even know them.  Can you name them?"
"__BEATLES__ Actually I can--John Lennon,  Paul McCartney, George Harrison,  and Ringo Starr."
"__BEATLES__ Very good, you don't know their songs, but you know their names--how come?"
"__BEATLES__ Read it it my high school history book."
"__BEATLES__ Very funny young man--maybe you should listen to the Beatles once in awhile instead of that rap stuff."
"__BEATLES__ Not too likely but what would you suggest."
"__BEATLES__ Maybe something from their psychedelic period like Strawberry Fields or Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."
"__BEATLES__ Psychedelic?  Interesting, but I have to run.  Tell me about it some other day."
