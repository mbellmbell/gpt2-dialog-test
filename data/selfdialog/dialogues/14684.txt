"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Any good movies playing this weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ hmm...doesn't look like it.. Oh wait, there's the new Terminator Genisys movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I heard it wasn't a bad movie, I'll go see it if you come with me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, we can go right now if you want to."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you seen The Hateful Eight yet? It's so funny!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, but I heard great things about it. I guess I have to see it now."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, you have to! Let me know when you go to watch it. I wouldn't mind watching it again!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Probably tonight, if you're not busy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, The Hunger Games Mocking Jay is finally out!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No way! The first movie was so good. We HAVE to go see it right away!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Right? This one will probably be BETTER. Wanna go see it? Sometime tomorrow?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You don't have to ask me twice! Yes!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ My dad wants to take me to the movies but we can't decide what to watch."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ How about Tomorrowland? That's something I think your dad would like."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't know, that movie is a little boring. You sure he would like it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, probably. Doesn't hurt to try."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, true. Okay, I guess I'll take him tomorrow."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you seen Trainwreck yet?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No, I haven't. Have you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I thought we could go later to watch it together. That's why I asked if you saw it yet."
