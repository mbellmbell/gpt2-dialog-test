"__DISNEY__ How many animated Disney movies are there?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, it depends on how you classify them. All animated movies, only classics, Pixar included? That's not an easy question!"
"__DISNEY__ Okay, I will narrow it down. Animated Disney classics."
"__DISNEY__ I think there are around 30."
"__DISNEY__ It seems like there are more."
"__DISNEY__ Well, for example, I don't think Princess and the Frog is considered a Disney classic."
"__DISNEY__ Who even decides that?"
"__DISNEY__ I have no idea!"
"__DISNEY__ Was Snow White the first though."
"__DISNEY__ Yes it was."
