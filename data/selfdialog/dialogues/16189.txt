"__ROCK__ What was the name of that first guy, before Mike Patton?"
"__ROCK__ You mean in Faith No More? Chuck Moseley."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, that dude. I keep hearing how good the first two albums are, but I can't get past his voice."
"__ROCK__ It's a bit of a barrier, isn't it. It always sounds like he's got a head cold."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, I guess so. I was wondering if it was just my preconceptions, because I was so used to Mike Patton and... well, you know what his voice is like."
"__ROCK__ No, it's not just you. I'd like to hear most of Introduce Yourself with Patton on the vocals; it'd be a lot like The Real Thing, I think."
"__ROCK__ I wouldn't go that far. Then again, I haven't been able to really pay attention to the music."
"__ROCK__ I think it's reasonable; The Real Thing was mostly written with Chuck Moseley in mind. Mike Patton strolled in with basically a completed album, and sang the words in front of him."
"__ROCK__ Oh, God. I can't fathom how that would have sounded -- all those epic anthems and things."
"__ROCK__ I can sort of hear it with 'Epic,' speaking of. Maybe 'Underwater Love'?"
