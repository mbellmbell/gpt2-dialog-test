"__MUSIC__ What do you think about Metallica releasing a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ I have enjoyed their music in the past, but some of it has not been very good."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I agree. They are also getting up their in age."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if their age will change the sound of their music."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't think it would, but maybe. Things changed as you age."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sometimes things you like when your younger, you don't care so much for as you get older."
"__MUSIC__ True, that can be said about a lot of things."
"__MUSIC__ I just hope it's not as bad as some of their more recent albums."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wish they would get back to the way they were during the Black album or And Justice for All."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't you forgetting Master of Puppets?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah, I also meant that album."
"__MUSIC__ So do you think you will pick it up when it comes out."
"__MUSIC__ Probably, after I listen to some of it online first."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't want to buy something that I am going to hate."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I doubt I would hate the entire album either way, but I would like to enjoy more of it than I hate."
"__MUSIC__ That can not be said about some of their past albums, like Load and Reload."
"__MUSIC__ God, those were terrible."
"__MUSIC__ That is what I am afraid they are going to release this time, quality wise."
"__MUSIC__ I am sure they learn their lesson after those two albums."
"__MUSIC__ One can only hope."
