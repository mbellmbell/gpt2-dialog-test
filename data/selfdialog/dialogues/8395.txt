"__BEATLES__ What's your favorite Beatles' song?"
"__BEATLES__ Tough call. I think it's a toss-up between Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da and Hello, Goodbye."
"__BEATLES__ I think I was expecting something like Yesterday, but Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, it's a really happy, catchy song.  I especially like the mistake when the names get switched."
"__BEATLES__ Maybe I should listen to it again, I don't think I remember it that well."
"__BEATLES__ You should, it's a good song.  What about you, what's your favorite?"
"__BEATLES__ No. It's Baby, You're a Rich Man."
"__BEATLES__ Really?  Not All You Need Is Love?"
"__BEATLES__ I really like All You Need Is Love, but Baby, You're a Rich Man is just a weird, fun song."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I guess it is.  It suits you."
