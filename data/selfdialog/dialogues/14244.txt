"__HORROR__ Hey, have you ever seen the original version of The Exorcist?"
"__HORROR__ The one with Linda Blair?  I saw it some time ago."
"__HORROR__ I think it's one of the scariest movies ever made."
"__HORROR__ It really frightened me when I saw it.  It stays with you."
"__HORROR__ Yes, I didn't want to turn the lights out when I went to bed after watching it."
"__HORROR__ That scene where Linda Blair's character vomits is so gross!"
"__HORROR__ I have laughed at that part when I've been in the right mood."
"__HORROR__ I think it's so eerie when she talks in that possessed voice."
"__HORROR__ Oh, that's one of the more disturbing parts."
"__HORROR__ I used to do an impression of her voice when I was in college.  People would laugh."
