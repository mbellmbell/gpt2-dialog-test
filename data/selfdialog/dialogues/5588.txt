"__STAR_WARS__ Which Star Wars movie do you like the most?"
"__STAR_WARS__ For me, it's Empire Strikes Back, because when I was a kid the wait to see what happened next was so long and exciting!"
"__STAR_WARS__ You don't find that Empire seems outdated compared to today's movie standards?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you can't compare older movies' effects to today's CGI stuff, which is why George Lucas went back and tried to digitally edit new CGI in."
"__STAR_WARS__ That didn't go too well, since it made the new graphics in all of those original trilogy movies stick out like a sore thumb."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, but you'll note that Empire Strikes Back had the least amount of new scenes added for the Special Edition."
"__STAR_WARS__ That probably means Empire Strikes Back was probably good enough to stand the test of time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly what I was saying, and that's one of the main reason why I think Empire Strikes Back is my favorite!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I thought Jar Jar was funny in the Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'I don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain' - That's a line from Empire Strikes back and fitting to what you just told me."
