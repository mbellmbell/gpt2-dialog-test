"__MUSIC__ Did you know that Tears for Fears is going back out on tour?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't even know they were still together."
"__MUSIC__ They broke up once or twice, but they're working on a new record."
"__MUSIC__ That's great. I haven't heard anything from them since the mid-90s."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't check out Everybody Loves a Happy Ending?"
"__MUSIC__ Is that one of their singles?"
"__MUSIC__ It was their last album, released in 2001."
"__MUSIC__ No, I can't say that I even knew about it."
"__MUSIC__ Check it out. Oh, and the tour will be with Hall & Oates."
"__MUSIC__ See I'm not a huge fan of Hall & Oates."
"__MUSIC__ I like the big hits, but I don't know much of their other work."
"__MUSIC__ They were good to dance to in the clubs back in the 80s, but that's about it."
"__MUSIC__ I hope to God the two aren't just doing a big 1980s-show."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I really like Tears for Fears, but I don't like nostalgia shows."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I get you."
"__MUSIC__ I would hope that after ten years they would have something new."
"__MUSIC__ Well there's only one way to find out."
"__MUSIC__ Get tickets? Way ahead of you."
"__MUSIC__ I hope they show's not on a weekday."
