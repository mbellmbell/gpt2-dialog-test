"__MOVIES__ I went to see Wonder Woman last night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! It was everything I hoped it would be and more."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! I'm going to see it this weekend. Tell me how it was without spoilers."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so it stays true to the comics in many ways, but makes a few necessary tweaks to work well with the other DC movies."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds fair. I don't like it when they change the source material too much."
"__MOVIES__ Me either. Gal Gadot was amazing. Batman Vs. Superman left me wanting to see more of her."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree. She stole every scene she was in, in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Right. But at the same time, I was a little skeptical, because I only really know her from The Fast & The Furious."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not a fan of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me either. I heard Fast Five was good, but if it takes you five movies to make a good one, that's a problem."
"__MOVIES__ So, how was Gal Gadot? I want details."
"__MOVIES__ She was very charismatic. She did an amazing portrayal of Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ That's a relief. For some reason, it's been very hard for actresses to get the role of Wonder Woman down properly."
"__MOVIES__ Except for Lynda Carter."
"__MOVIES__ Of course. She will always be the original Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, I will never doubt Gal Gadot's acting skills again. She makes a great action star as well."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm glad you enjoyed the movie. I know how much of a DC fan you are."
"__MOVIES__ I hope you enjoy it as well, when you see it this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ I'll let you know what I think!"
