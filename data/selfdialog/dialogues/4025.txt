"__MUSIC__ Nickelback is coming, we are thinking about going."
"__MUSIC__ I like them, but not sure it's worth the money"

"__MUSIC__ I've heard they put on a good show"
"__MUSIC__ We shall see!  We also saw Donovan earlier in the spring"
"__MUSIC__ How was that"

"__MUSIC__ I enjoy going to see local bands"
"__MUSIC__ I do too, but it doesn't seem like there are as many options for that anymore"
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean, our cafe used to have a group every weekend but they don't anymore"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think that costs are just too much"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't bought a cd in ages"
