"__MOVIES__ Hey, what do you think of all of the Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I prefer the originals when George Lucas directed them."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, he didn't have anything to do with all of the newer ones?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he just created & directed parts 4, 5, & 6."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I thought that he at least had something to do with episodes 1 thru 3 as well."
"__MOVIES__ Nope, and the originals will always be the best."
"__MOVIES__ The originals from the 1970's were really awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they were using what was cutting edge special effects & make up."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that to make it look like the sand cruiser was flying, they just smudged up the film strip with some Vaseline.  Is that true?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that is the truth! There were quite a lot of different effects that Lucas had to dream up."
"__MOVIES__ I'll never understand why Lucas sold the rights."
"__MOVIES__ He made a fortune plus made a mint by putting a clause in the sale that he gets to keep money from all future merchandise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a genius move on his end!"
"__MOVIES__ No one would have ever guessed that merchandise sales would be that big especially back in the 70's."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any of the new Star Wars episodes?"
"__MOVIES__ No, after the debauchery that the studios passed off as parts 1 thru 3 tanked so bad, I'm just afraid the other movies will be just as disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ Well, i kind of liked the first 3."
"__MOVIES__ You're kidding! What on earth would make you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess I just like the story lines. It was the beginning even if it was written horribly."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I suppose everyone has something they like!"
