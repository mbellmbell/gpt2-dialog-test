"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you talking about NFL or soccer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL not soccer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really but I have watched a few Falcons games in my past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons new schedule is out for 2017 and their first game is August 10 in Florida."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is it on TV?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they are all televised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do all NFL teams get all their games televised?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then how do they figure it out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that first game I mentioned for the Falcons was one of 4 preseason games. They are all televised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many regular season games are there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their schedule says 12 games and 1 bye. All of them on are on TV."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it depends on what their ranking is going into this season  to who gets  televised maybe?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No it usually  gets played on local networks but sometimes it depends on the large net work if they are going to play it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds too confusing to me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever is going to make the most amount of money for the large network is probably the way it works for the most part."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ oh yes it's all about the money and not for the love of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am glad i am not a football fan because it always made me mad when a game wasn't televised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see how that would be very annoying."
