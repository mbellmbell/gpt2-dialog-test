"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the last Star Wars movie, Rogue One?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it?"
"__MOVIES__ I was shocked that the entire cast died!  Wow, don't get too attached to any characters, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it did answer a huge issue from before."
"__MOVIES__ You mean about the two meter opening that would allow the Death Star to be blown up?"
"__MOVIES__ That's the one.  That always seemed to be a plot hole to me.  In fact, it's often made fun of...."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I get that."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, you make a giant moon-sized death ship and leave a single port open to destroy it?  Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  But this did explain the reason -- that the architect forced to make this machine did not believe in it and DID want it destroyed."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  And it did humanize things a bit."
"__MOVIES__ I did like a female protagonist."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, until now Star Wars always had kind of limited female roles."
"__MOVIES__ But like prior Star Wars movies, the characters still felt a little flat, 2-dimensional."
"__MOVIES__ Until the end of the movie, I agree that the characters were a bit non-descriptive.  However, I also liked that the male/female leads went from enemies to friends ..."
"__MOVIES__ And that at the end of the movie, there was the idea that they might have been something more?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  But, wow, to have all of the characters die -- one after the other."
"__MOVIES__ They really believed in the cause."
"__MOVIES__ And, of course, Kari Fisher's cameo...."
"__MOVIES__ Her second-to-last for the franchise.  Very sad."
