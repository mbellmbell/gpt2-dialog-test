"__MOVIES__ Have you seen La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ I have! How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good. I am a big musical person though."
"__MOVIES__ So am I. I thought it was interesting how the singing in the movie was actually pretty average."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that is true. I hadn't really noticed that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Ryan Gosling is a great actor but maybe not the most talented singer!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Manchester by the Sea?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't. Have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is incredibly sad. I'm not sure I can recommend it."
"__MOVIES__ That is what I've heard as well. Did it come out in 2016?"
"__MOVIES__ It did. So did Moonlight. Did you see Moonlight?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep! It was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ I thought so too."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think it should have beat La La Land for Best Picture?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely! That was really crazy."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Both are great movies though."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Are you going to see the new Baywatch movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably not, I never saw the original show. Did you?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, I think I might go see Baywatch later this week though."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know how it is!"
