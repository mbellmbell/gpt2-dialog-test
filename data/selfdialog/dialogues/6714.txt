"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about Return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, it's better than the prequels, that's for sure."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not as good as the other original trilogy movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's right. It's not quite there."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why? Is it something about originality?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Mostly that's it. It's far more recycled than the others."
"__STAR_WARS__ The death star narrative repeating itself?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's part of it. The end game between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was also predictable."
"__STAR_WARS__ You thought Vader being redeemed was predictable?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, it was hinted at. But Luke defeating Vader and killing the Emperor was obvious."
