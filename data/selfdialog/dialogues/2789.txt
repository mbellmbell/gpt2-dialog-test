"__MUSIC__ When I was in middle school I had a big emo and scene phase..."
"__MUSIC__ No way! I did too."
"__MUSIC__ All I listened to was stuff like Panic at the Disco and Fall out Boy."
"__MUSIC__ See, I was more of an Evanescene person."
"__MUSIC__ All three of them are great though."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed! I wonder if Evanescene are still together."
"__MUSIC__ I thought they were! But maybe not."
"__MUSIC__ We can always look it up."
"__MUSIC__ Bring me to Life is that song though."
"__MUSIC__ It's my karaoke go-to song, actually."
"__MUSIC__ Mine is Fall out Boy's I don't Care."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That song is so catchy."
"__MUSIC__ I just like the fast beats and really, how hard it goes in."
"__MUSIC__ Same! The music video is great too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I've seen it! With the masks!"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I think they are funny and it's creative."
"__MUSIC__ Panic at the Disco is also like that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, too bad it's pretty much a different band now."
"__MUSIC__ I Write Sins is still a classic though."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it is."
