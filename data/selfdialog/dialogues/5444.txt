"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, The ending was so sad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right? I really liked Jyn and Cassian."
"__STAR_WARS__ They both would have been good long term characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess their story had to go how it did so that it blends into the original three movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but I would have made the robot for more future movies rather than an earlier story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh K-2S0? Yeah C-3P0 seems to be a step back in intelligence."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think so too. K-2S0 is much more advanced in interaction and of course humor."
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutely! I loved the banter between him and the human characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was some of the best dialog in the movie."
