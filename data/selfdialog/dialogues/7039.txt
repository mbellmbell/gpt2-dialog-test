"__ICEHOCKEY__ The next match in on Saturday, are you going?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm not sure if I can afford tickets, how much are they and are you going?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I believe tickets are $50 each, yes I am going."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh that's not too expensive and I love the New York Rangers! I'll go to the game!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's great! Hopefully the Rangers win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Rangers are way better than Ottawa Senators, their goalie has many more saves."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes he does, and I believe defense is the most important part of ice hockey."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'm thinking of signing my son up for ice hockey, what do you think?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think that's a great idea, start them while they're young!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Absolutely! I'm going to train him to be a goalie!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe one day he'll play for the New York Knicks!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, maybe we'll be watching him together!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I used to play ice hockey as a kid, that was a great experience!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why did you stop playing?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I got too many knee injuries and had to hang up the stick."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's too bad, what position did you play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I played goalie, what a strange coincidence."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes that is very strange because we were just talking about the Rangers goalie!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I have to leave, see you Saturday at the Rangers game!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, see you there!"
