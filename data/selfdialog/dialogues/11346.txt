"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how about those Miami running backs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Obviously the conversation there starts with Jay Ajayi."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, quite a year he had last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was, he really burst onto the scene when he got a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it wasn't all good for him, was it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he had three games over 200 yards, but only one other game over 100 yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And he did not catch the ball well at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, he only had 27 receptions on the season, and he had 10 of those in two games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he has some things to work on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The key here is that he is working on them.  Reports out of camp are that he is working hard and is now a better receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the other backs on the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, basically they have two other experienced backs and some guys who are long shots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Damien Williams and Kenyon Drake?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, those two are pretty well known quantities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Damien Williams flirted with the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but he was never really going anywhere.  He is too valuable as a receiver and special teamer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Kenyon Drake?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has home-run hitter all over him.  He can make game breaking plays, they just need to make sure they are positive plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone of note in the other guys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not, but they have training camp to show what they can do."
