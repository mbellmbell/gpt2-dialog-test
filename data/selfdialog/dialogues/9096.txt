"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the game last night between the Cubs and the Yankees?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes I did! It was such a close game."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe it lasted 18 innings, what a game!"
"__BASEBALL__ Severino brought his A game for sure."
"__BASEBALL__ I know! Crazy! He pitched a velocity of 100.2 MPH."
"__BASEBALL__ Alot of sliders and fastballs...insane!"
"__BASEBALL__ What about the Mets though, did you hear what happened?"
"__BASEBALL__ No I didn't! What's up?"
"__BASEBALL__ They suspended Matt Harvey three days without pay for an undisclosed violation of team rules."
"__BASEBALL__ Whoa! For real?? What did he do?"
"__BASEBALL__ Apparently he was suspended after not showing up to the ballpark Saturday."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yea, that'll get you. I wouldn't have done that if I were him."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea...it really took a hit on the team."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea! They were crushed by the Marlins right?? 7-0."
"__BASEBALL__ Ouch...just hearing that hurts my ears."
"__BASEBALL__ What about the Reds vs. Giants game??"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh man, that game was interesting! The Reds outscored the Giants big time 27-5 last Friday and Saturday combined."
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, I thought that the Giants had a more hopeful future."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. They've had the worst season NHL 11-21."
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely don't see a celebration in the near future."
