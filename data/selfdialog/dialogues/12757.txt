"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am a football fan and a bit of a historian on it.  Do you like football too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I liked all the old players and about some of the old games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some of the guys were so tough back in the day.  They played both offence and defense for the whole game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they were.  One time in a championship game the field was really slippery so they went out at halftime and got sneakers and changed shoes which gave them the edge for the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw the first Super Bowl and remember that it was really cold and the Packers won the first two Super bowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Vince Lombardi was the coach and the trophy won at the Super bowl was named for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had so many tough guys playing, like Jim Brown who rushed for so many yards.  He was amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love the running backs like O.J. who was such a great player but so sadly fell and became criminal after his career was over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ George Blanda was a great player.  He was a great quarterback and kicker and extended his career by becoming a kicker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure.  He was the highest scorer when he retired and held the record for so many years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember Super Bowl 3 when Joe Namath assured a win when he was the underdog."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And then they beat the favored Colts.  Soon after the NFL and AFL merged."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The player I loved for his play and presence was Joe Montana.  He was the comeback kid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There was no one like him when his team got behind and needed to score in the waning moments of a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did it about 30 times if I remember right, how awesome is that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a good role model too.  They are hard to find, so many players receive so much for playing and seem so selfish."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I liked that Tim Tebow.  He seemed to play well with Denver but the sent him off to take Peyton Manning  instead."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was the end of Tebow.  He floated around a bit but never caught on anywhere else, almost like he was a joke or something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess my favorite player was a real rebel.  Jim McMahon of the Bears."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had good chemistry with coach Mike Ditka.  It was a flash in the pan but a remarkable time in football."
