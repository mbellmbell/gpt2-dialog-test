"__COMEDY__ Who is your favorite comedic movie star?"
"__COMEDY__ Bill Murray, no doubt."
"__COMEDY__ Which of his movies do you like?"
"__COMEDY__ Be easier to answer which ones don't I like."
"__COMEDY__ Try. Which ones do you like."
"__COMEDY__ Groundhog Day, Caddyshack is a classic. Quick Change isn't as well known as the others but is still great. He only has a small role in Tootsie, most people think of Dustin Hoffman, but Murray is really good in it Then there's Stripes, another Bill Murray classic."
"__COMEDY__ Most of those are older movie. All of them actually. Anything new?"
"__COMEDY__ Again, he only had a small role in it but I loved his brief appearance in Zombieland"
"__COMEDY__ What other new movies has he done?"
"__COMEDY__ Most of his newer movies haven't really been comedies. St. Vincent and Lost in translation. If they're comedy, they're more subtle, more thoughtful."
