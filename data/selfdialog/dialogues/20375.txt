"__MOVIES__ Lets talk Smokin Aces."
"__MOVIES__ OMG, tht movie was intense."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was. I am suprised it did not get more acclaim than it did."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding! The filmography alone was superb. Totally realistic."
"__MOVIES__ And a totally ensemble cast. Ryan Reynolds was fantastic in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and each character you got so sucked up in. I wish it had been a three hour movie just to get more of the characters."
"__MOVIES__ For sure. Jeremy Pivin as Buddy Aces was perfect. He brought the drama!"
"__MOVIES__ His interaction with Common was unreal. I was gripped."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the whole 'Unusual Suspects' twist to it also."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, i know there was a couple of 'Unusual Suspect' kinda movies, but Smokin Aces is one of the few that truly pull it off."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. It kept you drawn in start to finish."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and Chris Pine as one of the Tremor Brothers was fantastic!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, actually all three of them, Chris Pine, Kevin Durand and Maury Sterling were unbelieveable, stole the show!"
"__MOVIES__ Funny how all three of them never played such characters before."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't even recoginize Maury Sterling. He must be a lot shorter in real life or they did some unreal camera angles."
"__MOVIES__ True. The scent where Chris Pine kills Ben Affleck and he moves his jaw like he was talking had me in stitches"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that was as crazy as when that kid on ridalin was doing the 'Kung-Fu Boner' scene."
"__MOVIES__ OMG, i was in tears laughing at that scene!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Its a fantastic movie."
"__MOVIES__ I agree 100%!"
