"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think about the Rebel Alliance?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They were more than just a group of guerilla fighters"
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue One showed how organized they had become even though there was still a senate"
"__STAR_WARS__ The number of ships they had and the size of them shows how much support they had"
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be interesting to know how they got their funding"
"__STAR_WARS__ You assume the Empire was funded by taxes. But the rebel's government support was questionable"
"__STAR_WARS__ Alderaan must have supported the rebels."
"__STAR_WARS__ The base on Hoth and on Yavin seemed to be far from civilization"
"__STAR_WARS__ It is likely the Death Stars cost more than all of the other ships the Empire had put together"
"__STAR_WARS__ The rebels made better decisions with their money"
