"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think of the original Star Wars trilogy vs. the new ones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I much prefer the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do too. They were a defining set of films for my younger days."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought the second three films were just awful, story-wise. The casting wasn't much better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I think Jar-Jar Binks should haunt George Lucas for eternity. What a gawdawful stepin fetchit character."
"__STAR_WARS__ And how did you like the way a bunch of those bad guy aliens talked like imperialist Chinese leaders? How embarrassing."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the dude they cast as Anakin, hoo, what an awful actor. How can you get into a story when you're cringing at the lead guy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I absolutely hated, HATED the end of the trilogy, with Luke's mother just...dying for no reason at all, and retconning the whole first trilogy, and not in a good way either."
"__STAR_WARS__ I totally agree. The first trilogy had mythic themes, noble characters, lots of emotion, beautiful themes, and a satisfying conclusion."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would much rather watch the first three films and just forget the next three even existed. Except for Ewan MacGregor, he's the only one who came out of that mess with a little dignity."
