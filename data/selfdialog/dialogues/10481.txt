"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I used to get upset with the new hip hop, but then I just decided to spend my time and energy revisiting the older music I prefer"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What bothers you about new hip hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It doesn't sound good."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Like the beats aren't as good or the lyrics aren't as good?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Both aren't as good to me"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think it has to do with over-production or under-production?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It just doesn't sound like the boom bap anymore.  It's just all electronic now"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But isn't boom bap generated all electronically as well?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but they sampled records, and now it's all sounds from the computer; beeps and lasers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't even listen to hipk hop anymore."
