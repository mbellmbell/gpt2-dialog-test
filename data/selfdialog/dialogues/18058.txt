"__MOVIES__ Of all the Star Trek movies, I think I enjoyed 'Wrath of Khan' the most."
"__MOVIES__ I think most Star Trek fans would agree with you. Except maybe for 'Undiscovered Country'."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a good one, too. I have to admit, any Star Trek movie that has Kirk/Spock moments really make me happy."
"__MOVIES__ Oh? You're a Kirk an Spock fan?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, of course. I think I liked Spock best for a long time, but gradually I began to like Kirk's character even more."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that? I mean, why switch from one character to another?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I think, actually, I was enjoying the rapport between Spock and Kirk, really - I mean, Nimoy and Shatner."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they seemed really well suited for each other. At least, when they were working together."
"__MOVIES__ 'Wrath of Khan' really showed viewers that relationship, and played it against a really great villain."
"__MOVIES__ You mean Khan, right? That was Ricardo Montalban, and he played khan in the Original Series episode, 'Space Seed'."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he did. Sometimes I think he 'got' the character better in the film."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah- he grew as a bad guy, getting even stronger than before."
"__MOVIES__ I can't get that vision of his big chest out of my mind! Shatner said he took the role very seriously, and really worked out for the part."
"__MOVIES__ Huh, kind of makes you wish Shatner had worked as hard. He was getting a little pudgy again."
"__MOVIES__ Form what I heard, he lost a lot of  weight for 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture'. Maybe it was getting too hard for him to lose that weight."
"__MOVIES__ Old age gets the best of us. I don't even know how old he was when they shot that. Maybe his early 60's?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. Nimoy was noticeably older, but he never had to lose weight. I loved that about him."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't he really tall, too?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. They always said that Shatner had to wear lifts, but I saw him in person myself, and the guy is only two inches shy of six feet."
"__MOVIES__ So Nimoy had to be at least six foot and a few inches. That's one tall Vulcan."
