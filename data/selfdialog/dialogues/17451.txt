"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Rocky movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Rocky IV. That's the one with the Russians, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That was an awesome Cold War-era movie. However, I think that Red Dawn was my favorite Soviet-themed movie from that period."
"__MOVIES__ Also a great film. I love Patrick Swayze movies!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too! Ghost and Dirty Dancing are two of my favorite 80s movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but Roadhouse is kind of cheesy."
"__MOVIES__ That's what makes the film so awesome. The 1980s was the era of ridiculous action stars like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger."
"__MOVIES__ Very true. Do you think that we'll ever have movies like Terminator or Rambo again?"
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately no. Nowadays, movies are more difficult to make, so studios are less likely to make movies not based on popular source material."
"__MOVIES__ That would explain the proliferation in comic book movies over the past decade."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, although the Avengers is still a great franchise."
"__MOVIES__ It's fun, but they rely way too much on explosions and the plots can be thin."
"__MOVIES__ If you're going to an Avengers film expecting to find an amazing plot, you're probably missing the point."
"__MOVIES__ True. However, I thought the Ironman movies had the right mix of plot, action, and humor."
"__MOVIES__ I would agree with that assessment for the first and third Ironman films. However, Ironman 2 was weird."
"__MOVIES__ Totally agree. I just felt that once they started to weave the Avengers narrative Iron Man 2, things started to get unnecessarily complicated."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It seems like DC Comics is starting to copy Marvel in that respect in their films today."
"__MOVIES__ The problem with DC Comics is that they haven't made any good films yet. Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was terrible."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, although Wonder Woman is supposedly really good."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I should probably check it out then."
