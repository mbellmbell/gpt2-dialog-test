"__STAR_WARS__ Who is the most powerful Jedi from the Star Wars Movies"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Luke Skywalker, but I guess yoi could say Anakin Skywalker too"
"__STAR_WARS__ Before Anakin turned to the dark side during Revenge of the Sith you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, because Darth Vader does not count as a Jedi"
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes sense, but I do think Yoda may be the most powerful"
"__STAR_WARS__ In Attack of Clones we saw him fight Count Dooku so that makes sense"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda was both wise and powerful, which is why he trained Luke"
"__STAR_WARS__ Obi-Wan Kenobi is underrated though, he was also very wise"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda and Obi-Wan together in the Empire Strikes Back were a formidible duo for Jedi training"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait we forgot about Mace Windu"
