"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, who are you most looking forward to seeing play this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think this might be the Cowboys year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? It seems like they always figure out how to screw it up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but they have all the pieces in place. I wish they would stop blowing draft picks on thug players though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Greg Hardy was a disaster of a pick - and to take him so early could be a disaster. They've gotten through it though before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are getting around him with their most recent draft pick too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. It'll be interesting to see what the Patriots do too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like most Americans, I'm pretty sick of them winning every year. I think it's become a thing to cheer against them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I certainly do that as well. The lack of interest in watching the same teams win over and over is real."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am very interested in seeing the new teams and the relocation teams though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah - I was shocked that the Raiders are actually moving to Vegas and the two teams playing in Los Angeles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see the two in LA as a feasible thing forever. I don't like that and I'm sure they don't either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But there are the two teams that play in 'New York' - but actually play in New Jersey"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, they share a stadium and such, but the Jets aren't good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's also true, but the Rams haven't been good for a very long time either. The Chargers aren't good either right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Vegas move shocked me because they have one of the most reputable fan bases in the world."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Vegas just got a hockey team too, so I'm not really sure what is so big about Vegas, the city doesn't impress me that much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose it is good for the Raiders, because they will sell out every game with tourists from elsewhere, but they do abandon one of the most blueblood fan bases and loyal fanbases too!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we'll have to see what happens when it happens."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Very true. Can't wait."
