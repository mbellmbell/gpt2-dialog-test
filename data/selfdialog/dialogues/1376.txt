"__MUSIC__ Do you play any instruments?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I took clarinet lessons as a kid, but I didn't really like it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really?  How long did you play it for?"
"__MUSIC__ About six or seven years, but I was never very good, to be honest.  How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I never learned anything.  I would love to learn guitar, if I had the time."
"__MUSIC__ I took a college course on guitar and it was pretty easy to learn.  You could probably teach yourself."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  The main reason I want to learn to play is to do covers of songs.  Nothing fancy."
"__MUSIC__ They actually make books with the sheet music for pop covers!"
"__MUSIC__ That's great, but I don't know how to read music."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure the instruction books would tell you how to read the notes.  And some of the sheet musics for guitars doesn't even use traditional notes.  It uses chords."
"__MUSIC__ Couldn't you just teach me?"
"__MUSIC__ No way.  I haven't played since college!  And without practice, it's easy to forget.  But if you signed up for lessons, I would probably sign up, too."
"__MUSIC__ How long do you think it would take to learn the guitar?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I took one semester of lessons, and I was able to play two songs at the end.  The lessons were weekly."
"__MUSIC__ That's not bad, I guess.  It's only six strings, right?"
"__MUSIC__ You're supposed to practice every day though.  Not just to get better, but because you need to build up callouses."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean, build up callouses?"
"__MUSIC__ The strings are made of wire and when you play guitar, it can really hurt your fingers."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, forget it.  I think I'll just take up drums instead."
"__MUSIC__ No, you should learn the guitar!  After all, you're already a champ at the air guitar."
