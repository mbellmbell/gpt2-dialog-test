"__MOVIES__ Did you like Jurassic Park?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it! The special effects that movie were amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the dinosaurs looked very real. Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job with that movie."
"__MOVIES__ What's amazing to be is that movie came out over two decades ago but the effects still look good."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, if that movie came out today it would look just like a modern movie."
"__MOVIES__ Which character was your favorite in that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked Malcom. Jeff Goldblum really made that character memorable."
"__MOVIES__ I can't imagine anyone else playing that part but Jeff Goldblum."
"__MOVIES__ The child actors were great too. They weren't annoying like a lot of children's part seem to be in big movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's because Steven Spielberg really knows how to direct children. You see that in lots of his movies with young characters."
"__MOVIES__ Jurassic Park was made right before CGI became common in movies so it was one of the last great practical effects mvoies."
"__MOVIES__ There was some CGI in it but the dinosaurs were mostly animatronics.  CGI was still pretty new at the time so Spielberg knew it had limitations."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked the Tyrannosaurus Rex scene. It was a genuinely terrifying scene."
"__MOVIES__ I saw it in the theaters and the roaring felt so real. The sound effects from that movie were really good."
"__MOVIES__ One interesting thing I read is how Spielberg had that scene take place in the rain at night to mask a lot of imperfections in the T-Rex design."
"__MOVIES__ Little details like that are what makes him such a good director. Less talented directors might ignore little things like that."
"__MOVIES__ It has all the elements of a great, exciting movie."
"__MOVIES__ It does. It has comedy, drama, horror, great effects, excitement, good characters."
"__MOVIES__ Samuel L. Jackson had a smaller role in Jurassic Park but I also liked his character too."
"__MOVIES__ He's great, pretty much any movie with Samuel L. Jackson in it is going to be good."
