"__STAR_WARS__ Have you watched Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I have. I have also watched the latest one too, with Rei and Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, I thought it was a good one, but the guy playing Kylor Ren was not that convincing. Definitely not Darth Vader material."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought Rogue one was kinda cool, but not as engaging when you watch it on DVD. Something is missing."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm glad at least Donnie Yen is in Rogue one. He is a cool guy and adds depth to the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah like Star Wars isn't only about light saber and laser guns, but can also be about martial arts."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue one i think is a good movie, but maybe because it's trying to jam a lot into a two hour movie, it seems quite complicated."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah while the other Star Wars movie is one of nine and Rogue One is totally entirely a different movie with a different timeline."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wonder if there will be a Rogue Two or something."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah we'll see that would be awesome."
