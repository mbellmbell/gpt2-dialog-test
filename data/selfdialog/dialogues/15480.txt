"__HARRY_POTTER__ Name the movie that this quote is from: 'You've got dirt on your nose, did you know?'."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Easy, 'Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone'! Hermoine says it to Ron Weasley on the train, right after they meet."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love that you're a Harry Potter fan! Here's another: 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light'."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can't remember which one it is from, but I know Albus Dumbledore says it to one of the kids. Which one was it again?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's from the third one, 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban'. Dumbledore says it to the whole school!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, you're such a nerd! Who is your favorite character again?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I have to choose just one character? My top 5 are Fred and George Weasley, Molly Weasley, Snape, Ron and Doby!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Those are good one! Molly Weasley is my favorite!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She's such a great mom, and so funny! 'Where HAVE you been?'"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So funny! Remember when she sent that screamer to Ron because he stole the car? I would've died if my mom did that!"
