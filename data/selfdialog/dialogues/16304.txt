"__ROCK__ I Prevail is quickly becoming one of my favorite bands."
"__ROCK__ Oh, I like them too. Have you heard their remake of Blank Space?"
"__ROCK__ I love that song! It's far better than the original."
"__ROCK__ They have another recent song, My Heart I surrender, that is awesome too. So moving but still hard rock."
"__ROCK__ I haven't heard that one. What other bands do you listen to?"
"__ROCK__ I like Disturbed as well."
"__ROCK__ I'm not a big Disturbed, but their remake of the Sound of Silence was amazing. I didn't realize his voice was that amazing."
"__ROCK__ Oh I know. That song is so much different than anything they've put out in the past."
"__ROCK__ I'll always be a fan of Breaking Benjamin and Shinedown."
"__ROCK__ I like both of them too. I love I'll Follow You by Shinedown. I listen to it everyday."
