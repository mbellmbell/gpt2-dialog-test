"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am in a couple leagues at work."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am having trouble deciding on who I should draft for my QB."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can gurantee they will get a few touchdowns each game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady looks better tham ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but Drew Brees is hanging in there with him. Each year the media tries to count him out."
