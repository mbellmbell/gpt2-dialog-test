"__POP__ Which artist which you say made better pop music? Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears?"
"__POP__ I would probably say Christina. Her songs have more depth and emotion."
"__POP__ That is true but Britney has some catchy tunes."
"__POP__ I know. I have danced to many of them with you on the dance floor."
"__POP__ Speaking of dancing, Christina has had some dance music herself."
"__POP__ Has she? I have never heard of the songs."
"__POP__ Yes she has. I don't think they did very well on the pop music charts."
"__POP__ Well, both artists are still relevant."
"__POP__ That is true. Christina is on the Voice and Britney has residency in Las Vegas."
"__POP__ I bet it would be fun to see Britney in Vegas!"
