"__DISNEY__ I always thought I had seen a lot of Disney movies, but apparently not..."
"__DISNEY__ There's a lot of Disney movies, so it's not surprising if there's some you haven't seen."
"__DISNEY__ There was a list challenge website that had 492 Disney movies, and you could click on each one that had a picture and the title that you'd seen, and it gave you a total."
"__DISNEY__ That kind of sounds like fun. Did it take a long time?"
"__DISNEY__ YES. About a half an hour. It was 13 pages of Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ So how many have you seen?"
"__DISNEY__ 67 out of 492. The average was 164. A LOT of people had claimed to have seen all 492, but I think they just cheated and clicked on them all."
"__DISNEY__ I know it seems like I've seen a lot, but I'm probably just like you."
"__DISNEY__ It was fun looking at all the old movie pictures, like Bambi and Cinderella, and 101 Dalmatians."
"__DISNEY__ The old Disney movies are my favorite too."
