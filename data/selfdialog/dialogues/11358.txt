"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which state has the worst football team in the NFL would you say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know give me a minute"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think the Raiders  really have not been popular for a while"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that? Because they have the most losses or what ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That, and possibly their players aren't too good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seem like if people like a certain NFL player, then they like the team as a whole"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just seems that they haven't been too popular"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. But have you been to one of their games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And it was pretty good but they lost"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did? To whom."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dallas Cowboys of course"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes well that's the best team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. But at least they need to develop a better strategy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well thats the coaches job"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Truely. If the team has a bad coach they wont be winning any games"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is their coach ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For the Oakland Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Is it still Jack Del Rio?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I think it is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh no wonder they are still losers. I don't think he's very good"
