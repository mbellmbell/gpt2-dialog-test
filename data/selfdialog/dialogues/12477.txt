"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, both of those teams will probably still be contenders, but maybe other teams will rise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, how about the Chiefs in the AFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure what to think about them honestly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they seem like they may be one of those teams built to win in the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Reid has had some playoff success in the past, but never brought superbowls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea and it seems similar in Kansas City."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They keep fielding great teams, but not winning when it matters most."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, that guy really showed what he can do last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they do have some talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a couple of running backs that can play too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, neither are stars, but they work well together."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, we will see if they have enough to get over the top this year."
