"__MOVIES__ So what's going on with DC movies?"
"__MOVIES__ yes, I was wondering the same thing!"
"__MOVIES__ they are just screwing up one movie after another!"
"__MOVIES__ yes, exactly! I mean look at marvel movies, it seems marvel knows the formula of success."
"__MOVIES__ yes, it's not hard to see difference between marvel movies and DC movies"
"__MOVIES__ I personally think that DC people do not get a good director."
"__MOVIES__ yes, I mean they have tried zack schnider, he is a mediocre director, yet they keep giving him movies to direct."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know whoever is managing DC comics is exactly doing."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see batman vs superman?"
"__MOVIES__ oh yes, I have seen it, and I regret watching it."
"__MOVIES__ That movie just killed all the positive feelings I had for batman from christopher nolan series."
"__MOVIES__ I think batman trilogy was one of the best superhero trilogy series I have ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree with you. and after watching batman vs superman, I feel that they are by no means even closer to that trilogy series."
"__MOVIES__ But I think it would be unfair to compare batman trilogy with batman vs superman."
"__MOVIES__ The whole story felt so artificial, I couldn't see any solid reason batman would turn against superman."
"__MOVIES__ yes, the story was really poor, and without solid story, a movie is not going to be a great hit."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen trailer of new justice league movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but somehow I am not very impressed with it, even the trailer looks so mediocre that I have no plan to watch it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, unless critics come up with ridiculously positive reviews about it."
"__MOVIES__ well, I see very less chances of that happening, still, let's keep fingers crossed!"
