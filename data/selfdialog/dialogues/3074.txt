"__MUSIC__ Hey, the new Arcade Fire video is up!"
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I'll check it out."
"__MUSIC__ I've been looking forward to new stuff from them."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  It's been ages."
"__MUSIC__ I have to admit, this new song is not as catchy as the others, but it's still pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure it's good.  Remember the show we saw a few years back?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, thanks for taking me along.  I'd never really listened to them until then."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad you liked them.  I've been a fan for a long time, just hadn't gotten around to the new stuff yet."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were great.  I'd only heard a few songs from them before but the show was amazing."
"__MUSIC__ They're pretty theatrical.  Every concert I've been to has amazing multimedia."
"__MUSIC__ And how about the opening act?"
"__MUSIC__ The DJ?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Dan Deacon.  Remember when he had people come up and dance with him?"
"__MUSIC__ We should have gone down there!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, all the way from the third balcony, ha!"
"__MUSIC__ They used to change their opening act every month or so.  And had different genres too."
"__MUSIC__ I can see why.  They're pretty eclectic."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, they're good at everything."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.  So check out the new one.  It's no Reflektor, but it's catchy."
"__MUSIC__ Nothing beats Reflektor!"
