"__MUSIC__ You know, for as much as I like music, I realized that I am terrible about knowing artists' albums and what songs are on each one."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I don't know any of that either. The only artist that I can tell you detail about the albums is Bruce Springsteen?"
"__MUSIC__ Really? Bruce?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he is my all time favorite and over time, I guess I just learned most of his albums."
"__MUSIC__ I think I could name maybe four songs by him."
"__MUSIC__ Let me guess: Born to Run, Born in the USA, Dancing in the Dark, and Badlands."
"__MUSIC__ That's really funny. I think that pretty much covers it. How did you know?"
"__MUSIC__ Those are pretty much the songs that most people know. He has so much more though."
"__MUSIC__ I would think so. He has been around a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Forty-four years since his first album with the E-Street Band."
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious? His first album was in '73?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Greetings from Asbury Park. And he played with other bands before that but nothing that had any commercial success."
"__MUSIC__ That is a really long time. There aren't many other artists who have that kind of longevity."
"__MUSIC__ What is really impressive about him too is that he doesn't just rely on his older music. He still write and records new albums."
"__MUSIC__ That is impressive. So different that Billy Joel."
"__MUSIC__ I know. He is another artist with longevity and commercial appeal, but his last album came in what? 1991?"
"__MUSIC__ River of Dreams was 1993. He technically had one in 2001, but it was his classical compositions, not actually him singing."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't count that then!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know. It's just that most people don't know about that one."
"__MUSIC__ I certainly didn't."
