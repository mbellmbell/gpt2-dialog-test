"__HORROR__ So, another horror film I've been meaning to see is The Witch."
"__HORROR__ Oh, yeah, I've seen that one!"
"__HORROR__ Really?  Did you like it?"
"__HORROR__ I thought it was great!  Lots of good performances, really suspenseful.  Now, I gotta warn ya though..."
"__HORROR__ What's that?"
"__HORROR__ Well, it's rather slow paced, and that bothered a lot of people.  It's more a psychological drama in many ways than a horror film."
"__HORROR__ Oh, well, I can still do that.  As long as the story's interesting."
"__HORROR__ Oh, it is.  It's set in the colonial times with this exiled Calvinist family."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I gathered from the trailer is was during the time of the pilgrims."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, the director has been praised for really doing his research."
