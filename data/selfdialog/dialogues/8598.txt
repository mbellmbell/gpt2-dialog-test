"__BEATLES__ Hey, who's your favorite Beatle?"

"__BEATLES__ Well, John was an amazing songwriter too! He wrote In My life and Strawberry Fields Forever!"
"__BEATLES__ I know, it's so hard to pick. Speaking of songwriting -- don't forget George Harrison. He wrote Here Comes the Sun, one of my faves!"
"__BEATLES__ I didn't know George wrote that one? That's an awesome song."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, George Harrison wrote many songs but Paul and John usually didn't put many songs of his on the albums."
