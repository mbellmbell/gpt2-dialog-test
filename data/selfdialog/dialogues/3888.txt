"__MUSIC__ So did you know when Metric is coming out with a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I really wish they would."
"__MUSIC__ Oh?  I didn't know you were a fan really?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course!  I just love the way Emily Haines sings."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  They can be a little spotty, album-wise, though."
"__MUSIC__ True.  What was your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably Synthetica.  How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ It has to be Fantasies."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, that's a great one!"
"__MUSIC__ They incorporate so many sounds!"
"__MUSIC__ They sure do.  I really appreciate their New Wave influences."
"__MUSIC__ Of course!  Do you have a favorite song?"
"__MUSIC__ It would probably be Artificial Nocturne."
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  I love that one too!"
"__MUSIC__ I also loved Lost Kitten!"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, another right tune!  Now I can see why Synthetica is your favorite Metric album."
"__MUSIC__ It has to be.  I also like Dreams So Real and Breathing Underwater."
"__MUSIC__ You're making Synthetica my favorite Metric album now!"
"__MUSIC__ It sure is an outstanding album!"
"__MUSIC__ There's no doubt about that!"
