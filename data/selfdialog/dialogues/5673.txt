"__STAR_WARS__ I hope Rey isn't related to Luke or Han or Leia, like it was rumored."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because it feels like everything that happens in Star Wars revolves around those three."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you'd like to see more original characters?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. I'd like to at least have them acknowledge there are more than three people in the setting who do anything."
"__STAR_WARS__ In Rogue One, all of the characters were new."
"__STAR_WARS__ Rogue One was a really refreshing movie because of that."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was depressing, though. They all died in the end!"
"__STAR_WARS__ They sacrificed themselves for the Rebellion - as do many in the original movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. It served a wonderful thematic purpose."
