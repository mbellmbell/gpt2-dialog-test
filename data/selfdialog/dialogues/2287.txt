"__MUSIC__ Hey, what is that you are doing on the computer?"
"__MUSIC__ Just looking for some songs to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool! What kind of songs are you interested in?"
"__MUSIC__ Well right now I am looking for some older country songs. A friend of mine let me listen to some Johnny Cash songs and I fell in love with them."
"__MUSIC__ Was he the one who always wore black?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's him. He has some awesome songs so I thought I might like some more songs of that era."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite Johnny Cash song?"
"__MUSIC__ There are so many of them! I would have to say that my favorites are Ring of Fire, Folsom Prison Blues, and of course Hurt."
"__MUSIC__ Those are all really good ones. Have you listened to the ones that he did with his wife June Carter?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't heard any of them yet. What are some of the names?"
"__MUSIC__ There is Jackson, Cause I Love You, Old Time Feeling, and of course my favorite is Time's A Wastin."
"__MUSIC__ I will have to give all of those a try them. I love Johnny Cash now and I love the songs that I have heard from June Carter."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the two of them make an awesome duo."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of her biggest hits?"
"__MUSIC__ Wildwood Flower, The Loving Gift, and I Used To Be Somebody."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have ever heard of those."
"__MUSIC__ They are really good. You should give them a listen."
"__MUSIC__ I wish they were both still around making music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I would definitely like to go to one of their concerts."
"__MUSIC__ Me to, especially one that they did together."
