"__LADY_GAGA__ You know Weird Al's parody of Lady Gaga's Born This Way?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah! I actually like it a lot more than the original, not being a Lady Gaga fan."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Have you given her music a shot?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I haven't really had to. I mean, it's so popular I'm accosted with it when I go out or when I stay in."
"__LADY_GAGA__ When you stay in?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, like I was watching American Idol with someone and she was one of the people performing in between the contestants."
"__LADY_GAGA__ What did she perform?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Poker Face."
"__LADY_GAGA__ And what did you think of that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ That was enough for me to know I wouldn't really care for her music in general."
