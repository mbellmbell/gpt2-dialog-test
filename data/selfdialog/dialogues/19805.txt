"__MOVIES__ Hey! Have you seen any of the Pitch Perfect movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! My favorite is the first one. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ That was my favorite one too! I love Fat Amy's character."
"__MOVIES__ I know right. The third one comes out next year."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Yay. We should go see it together."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a plan! That reminds me, the second Incredibles movie is coming out in 2019."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my gosh, I can't wait. They keep postponing it!"
"__MOVIES__ We should dress up and go see that one too!"
"__MOVIES__ Let's do it! Haha! I'll be Mr. Incredible."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. I'm baby Jack Jack!"
"__MOVIES__ Pixar has my most favorite movies; Toy Story 1, 2, 3, and Up."
"__MOVIES__ They're all so wholesome. I think they're great too."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if they'll make another Toy Story eventually."
"__MOVIES__ No matter how old we get they're still enjoyable to watch. Isn't that funny?"
"__MOVIES__ You know what they say Pixar movies never get old!"
"__MOVIES__ Do they say that? I might've heard Woody say it once before. Haha."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe.. or Buzz Lightyear. Haha."
"__MOVIES__ I'm also looking forward to the remake of IT."
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't too scared by the first one but it was one of the first of its kind so I'm excited to see what they'll do with that."
"__MOVIES__ For us older folks it might just be a laughing matter to watch the youngins be scared, maybe even scarred."
