"__LADY_GAGA__ They are going to look mighty fine together."
"__LADY_GAGA__ This a country western remake, so we'll see and hear a different Gaga."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she'll do great. She's always reinventing herself."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw her do A-Yo live on Saturday Night Live. She was fantastic."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw it too. It was kind of a rockin' country song, and she did such a great job."
