"__MUSIC__ Did you hear the new Katy Perry song?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  Thankfully."
"__MUSIC__ Why?  You don't like her?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I can't stand her music."
"__MUSIC__ But, she's the voice of a generation!"
"__MUSIC__ Which generation?"
"__MUSIC__ The generation that knows nothing about music!"
"__MUSIC__ Clearly.  Now i'm going to have to hear her songs on the radio all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, whenever a new Katy Perry song comes out, they must play it four times every hour."
"__MUSIC__ That way, if you don't like her music, you eventually will."
"__MUSIC__ No, I think most people just continue to like it, unfortunately."
"__MUSIC__ I don't understand how she's so popular."
"__MUSIC__ The outfits and the colors might have something to do with it."
"__MUSIC__ That and maybe running around half naked."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, let's not forget the half nakedness!!"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, I hate her music."
"__MUSIC__ Even the song, Firework?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, even that song."
"__MUSIC__ It has a good message though."
"__MUSIC__ It does.  I'll give her that one."
