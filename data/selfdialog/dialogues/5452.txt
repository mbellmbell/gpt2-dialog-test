"__STAR_WARS__ I was three years old when Star Wars: A New Hope was released in 1977."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you get to see it in the theater?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, but I got to see on good old VHS later. I had a huge crush on Mark Hamill!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I  can understand that. I saw the older trilogy later after the Phantom Menace was released. But Mark Hamill was handsome as Luke in A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite actor from Phantom Menace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely Liam Neeson. He was so subtle and had a great acting style. He played Qui-Gon Jinn perfectly."
"__STAR_WARS__ I read that George Lucas filmed the Star Wars movies in the order that he did, because of the lack of CGI technology in the late 1970's and 1980's."
"__STAR_WARS__ I believe that's true. There is certainly more room to work in now regarding Sci-Fi movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think that the current technology takes away from the human element in the Star Wars saga now?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not at all. I think the actors shine ever more greatly and that is evident particularly in Rogue One when Cassius and Jyn embrace and die together, for the cause."
