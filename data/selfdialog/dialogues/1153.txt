"__MUSIC__ I really hope the Dresden Dolls are still together."
"__MUSIC__ Who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a punk duo out of Boston, sort of cabaret-like and definitely odd."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean odd?"
"__MUSIC__ Well essentially they're a pianist and a drummer who both play other things and sing, but since there's only two of them you don't get a lot of instruments at once."
"__MUSIC__ So not your standard rock/punk instrumentation then?"
"__MUSIC__ No, most of the time it's just piano, drums, lead-singer and back-up."
"__MUSIC__ And they're good?"
"__MUSIC__ They're really good, as long as you like them."
"__MUSIC__ That's an odd statement."
"__MUSIC__ The thing is the singing's pretty messy and a lot of the time the piano is thumpy and messy too."
"__MUSIC__ So where does the 'good' come in?"
"__MUSIC__ Their songs are interesting. Amanda (the pianist/singer) has a really neat voice. It's low and sounds kind of like a cello."
"__MUSIC__ Well that sounds pretty, if a bit odd for a girl."
"__MUSIC__ An angry cello."
"__MUSIC__ Now you're just making things up. Have I heard any of their songs?"
"__MUSIC__ The most popular one I think was Coin Operated Boy. A lot of people saw the video on Youtube."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I think I do remember that! They had white-face on right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Do you remember her voice now?"
"__MUSIC__ I do. It Is really low. Not sure I'd say angry cello but she definitely has an unusual singing style!"
