"__DISNEY__ What do you think of disney's more recent work?"
"__DISNEY__ I think disney puts out so many films it varies."
"__DISNEY__ That is a good point."
"__DISNEY__ The caliber of film they put out varies so widely, you have hits like frozen and but also have Teen beach movie 2."
"__DISNEY__ Ya, they almost seem from different worlds or studios altogether."
"__DISNEY__ They  are certainly different in quality."
"__DISNEY__ That is the thing with disney such a huge studio now they produce all kinds of movies."
"__DISNEY__ Well overall I think they produce some of the best films out even today. take frozen or even the new star wars films."
"__DISNEY__ True, the work they have done on star wars is impressive and high caliber.  But don't forget flops they have to like tomorrowland."
"__DISNEY__ I did not think of Tomorrwland as  a flop, but they do have different levels of work quality now more than the past."
