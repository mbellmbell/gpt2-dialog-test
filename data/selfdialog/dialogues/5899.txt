"__STAR_WARS__ I just rewatched all the old Star Wars movies this weekend."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's been a while since I've seen those, what'd you think."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's funny how obvious the new digital effects are."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean having a random Bantha in full digital randomly roaming outside the cantina on Tattooine wasn't normally there?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that's what I'm talking about.  Some of it was pretty cool though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The part with Han talking to Jaba before he take Luke and Obi Wan away from Tattooine."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea that part was really cool, but remember, Han shot first."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, I hate that they changed the confrontation scene in the Cantina.   I hate that Lucas changed it to make it a self-defense thing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, Han was supposed to be a marauder type.  Making him not shoot first was a bad idea."
