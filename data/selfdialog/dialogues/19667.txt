"__MOVIES__ I wonder when the horror movies began?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ What part of that don't you understand? When did the horror movies begin?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's a loaded question. First how do you define a horror movie? Suspense? Shock? Gore?"
"__MOVIES__ Um. I don't know. Horror movies, like Friday the 13th. Freddie, or Vampires, etc."
"__MOVIES__ Sigh. I think you have to be more precise here. Horror film is a genre named after the fact. We has amassed a certain number of films that seem to have similar qualities"
"__MOVIES__ Like? What qualities?"
"__MOVIES__ Induces fear, creates suspenseful atmosphere, causing physiological responses in the audiences like elevated heartbeat, sweaty palms,"
"__MOVIES__ Ok. yeah. So that's the horror movie. When did that begin?"
"__MOVIES__ Um.. are you listening to yourself? I just said it's a genre we have created after the fact. Movies were in existence already, and we 'decided' to call it the horror genre."
"__MOVIES__ So... you don't know."
"__MOVIES__ What!?!?! It's not something that's knowable. Thar's not an answerable question."
"__MOVIES__ So.... You. Don't. Know."
"__MOVIES__ ...I do know."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Tell me. When did the genre of Horror movies begin?"
"__MOVIES__ Let me see. Wait. I shall go look it up."
"__MOVIES__ That's cheating."
"__MOVIES__ No it's not, and here. I'm looking up how we define a horror movie. See, as long as visual, literary, artistic expression existed, horrifying images, texts, and depictions existed."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't answer my question."
"__MOVIES__ No, but it tells us why it is impossible to tell the beginning of the horror genre, because the depiction of horror has existed for many hundreds of years."
