"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football is right around the corner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I can't  wait. Who do you think we are going to see in the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but I can tell you who I'd like to see. Falcons and Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow! I don't think it's likely but what an amazing match up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Two amazing offenses, two amazing defenses. It would be a real game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're right it would be a close game too. Who would win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again I don't know, but I'd give money to see Marshawn Lynch talking to reporters after that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be entertainment enough. Speaking of Beast Mode, what about the Seahawks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they can get their locker room issues we could see them in the big game. It's football so I mean anyone could really make it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you want to see them play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Texas can figure out who is going to throw the ball"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be an interesting game but I don't see it happening. The Titans have some cleaning up to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle is going deep again though. I wouldn't be surprised if they went all the way once all the egos and feelings got put aside."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots against Seattle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be a good game, but New England would walk all over Seattle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle against the Raiders?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Raiders would have to make their way through New England and Pittsburgh and that's not going to happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it would be fun!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah watching Lynch play his old team and win!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything can happen!"
