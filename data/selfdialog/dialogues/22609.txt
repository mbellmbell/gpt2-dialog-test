"__DISNEY__ What's your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Hands down The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Nice that's my choice as well, such a classic film."
"__DISNEY__ It really is and I'm not ashamed to admit it, I cried when Mufasa died."
"__DISNEY__ It really hit you right in the heart, Scar was a great villain though."
"__DISNEY__ Oh absolutely one if the best that Disney has ever had."
"__DISNEY__ Couldn't agree more, but it was so nice when Simba got his revenge."
"__DISNEY__ It was truly a feel good sort of moment."
"__DISNEY__ I sometimes wish they would make a sequel, I know they have made a direct to video one, but a proper theatrical sequel."
"__DISNEY__ My only concern would be, could they capture the same magic again?"
