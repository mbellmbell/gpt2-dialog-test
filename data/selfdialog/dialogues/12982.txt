"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who don't you like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For me that's easy.........the Pats. and the 9'ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like the 9'ers specifically because I grew up a Bengals fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does that have to do with anything?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Bengals played in 2 Superbowls in the 80's and lost to the 49'ers both times on basically the last play of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sucks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it sucks, that's the main reason I despise the 49'ers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bengals had some good teams back in the 80's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they did. Kenny Anderson and Boomer Esiason were great quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First off they cheat, Belichick cheats and Brady is just too darn smug."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That Hernandez dude used to play for them also."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and look what he did to others and himself."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but you can't put that on the organization."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not? Even his teammates in college at Florida were afraid of him, stayed away from him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a really bad dude wasn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the dude murdered at least two people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Belichick is one heck of a good coach though isn't he? He wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will not say that because they have been caught cheating on multiple occasions."
