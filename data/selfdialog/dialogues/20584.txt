"__MOVIES__ So, what type of movies are you into?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, all sorts, but I really love kind of bad, crazy b-movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I mean, the kid that are so bad they're hilarious.  Especially when the people making them don't seem to realize how crappy they are."
"__MOVIES__ How could you not know you're movie's crappy?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, variety of reasons, but often it's not that the actors don't know, it's usually the higher ups.  Like in Troll 2."
"__MOVIES__ Troll 2?  Don't think I've heard of that.. or Troll 1 for that matter."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, that's beauty of it, you don't have to know anything about the first Troll movie to 'get' this one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, if you put in 'Troll 2' on youtube you'll see a ton of hilarious clips and reviews about it."
"__MOVIES__ I may have to try that."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah, if you like unintentionally campy stuff it's the best."
"__MOVIES__ So, what's the movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the 'plot' is this family, mom, dad, two kids, including a boy sees his dead grandfather's ghost, trade houses for a week with this family out in this weird town."
"__MOVIES__ Wait.. the kid sees his dead grandfather's ghost?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah! And that' snot even the craziest thing about the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Okay..."
"__MOVIES__ So, they go into this town called Nilbog (two points if you get what that stands for) and it turns out the townsfolk are goblins that want to kill and eat them."
"__MOVIES__ Er.. what?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know!  You'll be saying that a LOT during the movie.."
