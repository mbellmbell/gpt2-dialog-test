"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Angel of Darkness?"
"__MOVIES__ No. I haven't even heard about it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, do you like period dramas?"
"__MOVIES__ I love them. Do you think I would like Angel of Darkness?"
"__MOVIES__ You probably would if you like shows set in the Victorian period."
"__MOVIES__ I love stuff like that.  What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's based on the true story of a woman serial killer.  She killed her victims with arsenic."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting."
"__MOVIES__ She killed between 13 and 21 people.  I think she was a nutjob."
"__MOVIES__ Who plays in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's that one lady who plays Anna in Downtown Abbey.  Her name is Joanne Frogett, I think."
"__MOVIES__ I love her!  Is she just as good in this film."
"__MOVIES__ I think she is, but I have to warn you that this moving crosses a few lines for me."
"__MOVIES__ In what way?"
"__MOVIES__ You know how the British are when it comes to sex scenes.  Sometimes the go a bit far for me."
"__MOVIES__ Is there a lot of skin or something."
"__MOVIES__ Not that.  But it is pretty clear when a sex scene is on because they don't really hide any of the movement going on."
"__MOVIES__ Wouldn't it be great if we could filter crap like that and just enjoy the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  I almost didn't finish it, but the story intrigued me."
"__MOVIES__ I think I will take a look at it.  I love a Victorian mystery."
