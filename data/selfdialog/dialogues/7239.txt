"__LADY_GAGA__ I just heard Lady Gaga's song The Cure on the radio!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you like it?  I am still a little on the fence about it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I loved it!  Although I have to admit I had no idea it was her at first."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, her new sound showcases her voice a lot more."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I do like her more soulful sound, I'm glad she is trying something a little more deep."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I kind of miss her old stuff.  Born This Way was still pretty deep but a little more upbeat."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I guess that's true.  But I still like her slower stuff too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I am kind of glad that she has toned down her crazy antics though and is focused more on her voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I disagree!  I miss her in meat dresses and grand entrances."
"__LADY_GAGA__ The days of Bad Romance were pretty entertaining."
