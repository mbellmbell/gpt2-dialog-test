"__ACTION__ I wonder if they'll do another Sherlock Holmes movie."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, it's been a while."
"__ACTION__ They seemed to leave the last one open for a sequel."
"__ACTION__ Wide open!"
"__ACTION__ At any rate, if they don't do another in that series, I'm sure they'll reboot."
"__ACTION__ True. There's like a gazillion Holmes movies."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, and that show."
"__ACTION__ With Cumberbatch?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah."
"__ACTION__ That one's kinda weird."
