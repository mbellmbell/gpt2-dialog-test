"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the best quarterback in the NFL will be this year?  And you can't say Tom Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that kind of ties my hands, but I'll give it a shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, then.  Who are you picking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Aaron Rodgers?  He definitely makes the Packers go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a pretty good choice; I'll give you that.  But how about Matt Ryan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's pretty good for sure, but that Super Bowl loss last year makes me wonder about his big game ability."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To be fair, you can't really blame that all on him.  The offensive coordinator made several questionable play calls in the second half."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt.  And the Falcons could never get back in an offensive rhythm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have loved to have seen Atlanta win that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too.  I was really rooting for them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully, they will be able to make a return to the big game this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know.  Sometimes even the best teams never make it back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All right, then.  Who do you see in the Super Bowl this year if not the Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Call me crazy, but I think the Cowboys or the Packers may have a shot in the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's your AFC pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll take the Chiefs or maybe the Raiders, but it will probably be the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be happy to see either KC or Oakland?  It would be nice to see someone new have some success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though Brady is awesome and a decent guy, it's time for someone else to have a turn, indeed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, only about 2 months until the season begins and we can start seeing how it will all fall into place."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man, I can hardly wait!  I've been needing an pro football fix ever since the Super Bowl ended!"
