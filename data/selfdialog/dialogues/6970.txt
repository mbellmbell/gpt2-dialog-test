"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like there's a lot to like about the Star Wars franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ One of the thing's I've always liked is the merchandise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like all of the toy light sabers and things like that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah. It's a great way to expose kids to it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I remember that stuff being especially popular around that time of Episode 3."
"__STAR_WARS__ Revenge of the Sith, right? I get some of the prequels mixed up."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that's it. I really didn't think it was as bad as others seem to."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. It's just that the prequels tried to be a little too kid friendly."
"__STAR_WARS__ I get that, but I still don't mind it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can respect that."
