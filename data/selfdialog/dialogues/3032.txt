"__MUSIC__ Heard any good new music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Not too much actually."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me neither, I wish some of the newer bands got their names out there more."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, the music industry just isn't the same as it used to be anymore."
"__MUSIC__ True. At least there are tons of bands now though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's true."
"__MUSIC__ You always see like fifty local band names you've never heard of at concerts."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any good ones though?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, though my sister knows some good indie bands."
"__MUSIC__ Indie? What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a genre of music I guess."
"__MUSIC__ What's it like?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of newer bands you see are indie, it's kind of like pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, very interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes, it depends how good they are."
"__MUSIC__ You really don't hear much about indie bands, most of what you hear on the radio is by popular names."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's the way it is, pop music and pop artists have taken the spotlight."
"__MUSIC__ I don't like a lot of their music anyways."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither, but some of it is good."
"__MUSIC__ They should have more radio stations dedicated to new music."
