"__DISNEY__ Do you have a favourite Disney Princess?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, my favourite one is Princess Jasmine from the movie Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ Cool! She is my favourite too, I love that movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Do you know when that movie was released?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was some time in the 90's, but I can't be sure."
"__DISNEY__ Yea that's what I would guess too."
"__DISNEY__ I remember watching Aladdin as a child and always being amazed by his flying carpet."
"__DISNEY__ Tell me about it, I need a flying carpet of my own!"
"__DISNEY__ That would be so cool, I'd never be late to anything."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe a genie of my own too! I could use 3 wishes!"
