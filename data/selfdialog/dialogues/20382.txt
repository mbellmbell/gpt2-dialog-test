"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Silence of the Lambs?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, it's my favorite movie."
"__MOVIES__ Mine too!"
"__MOVIES__ Who's your favorite character?"
"__MOVIES__ Who do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Doctor Lector?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess he's my favorite too."
"__MOVIES__ You guess?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I really like Clarice."
"__MOVIES__ Of course, I do too. But Lector as a character is innately far more interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're right."
"__MOVIES__ I have to say, no matter how many times I watch it, I get so tense at the end when Clarice is in Bill's house."
"__MOVIES__ I end up yelling at the screen. It's so suspenseful."
"__MOVIES__ Especially when he has the night vision goggles and she doesn't."
"__MOVIES__ It's amazing she survives. Realistically, that wouldn't have happened."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he would have just shot her. She got too lucky."
"__MOVIES__ I guess we have to suspend our disbelief."
"__MOVIES__ Of course we do. It's a movie about a cannibal psychiatrist and a man who makes clothes out of women."
"__MOVIES__ Good point."
