"__MOVIES__ What is your top movie of the year so far?"
"__MOVIES__ I am torn between la la land and moonlight. what about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I really loved both , but prefer la la land. I am a huge ryan gosling fan. Have you seen drive?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I love that movie. So good, I especially liked the sound track.  Oscar issacs was in that  and he is really a great actor too."
"__MOVIES__ Oscar is really getting a lot more known and deservedly so. He was awesome in ex machina, did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ No what is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It is about artiffical intelligence, there is a girl robot . I don't want to give away too much but worth a watch. It also has alicia vakander in it."
"__MOVIES__ I like her. I will have to watch it soon. I loved her yellow dress at the oscars. Can you believe this year's best picture award issue?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it was so nuts! Never seen such a blunder. Poor  Emma stone. I felt so badly for her. She at least won for best actress."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, weird to think of her as an academy award winner. I think back to films like zombieland and easy A, likeable but no oscar performance."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. they are fun films and when I see them on tv I will usually end up watching them. What films do  you find yourself watching over and over again?"
"__MOVIES__ Goonies.I have seen it so many times now. It always seems to be on tv."
"__MOVIES__ Goonies is such a good 80's flick. I also love breakfast club."
"__MOVIES__ Breakfast club is a classic and also on constantly.  they are remaking so many 80s films now."
"__MOVIES__ I know, did you hear about the new blade runner?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes but not really a  true remake. It is a continuation of the original movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh cool! Ryan Gossling is it in too, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, got to love that! Also Harrison Ford returns should be pretty awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Ridley scott is pretty awesome in general. Totally excited for the new aliens movie by him too!"
"__MOVIES__ Agreed both ridley scott and the new alien movie are great!"
