"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the Queen of Katwe yet from Disney?"
"__DISNEY__ No but I heard it was really good."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it was a different kind of movie for them."
"__DISNEY__ I think it was based on a true story too."
"__DISNEY__ I think it was. I still haven't seen Finding Dory yet."
"__DISNEY__ Oh me neither but I heard it will make you cry."
"__DISNEY__ I heard the same thing. Finding Nemo definitely did."
"__DISNEY__ That's a classic. My kids wanted a clown fish after seeing it."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that's cute. Ellen Degeneres did a good job of playing Dory."
"__DISNEY__ Yes she's hilarious, I love her in anything she does."
