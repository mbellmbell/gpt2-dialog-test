"__MOVIES__ What is your opinion on Reboot  films?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not a fan of them to be honest with you."
"__MOVIES__ How do you feel they have done, good or bad?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say most reboot films are awful attempts at bringing back a popular series."
"__MOVIES__ Which would you say was the worst three reboots you've seen?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say Terminator Genisys, Total Recall, and Ghost Busters. What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Nightmare on Elm Street, The Thing and also Ghost Busters."
"__MOVIES__ Wait The Thing wasn't a reboot film."
"__MOVIES__ It wasnt? Are you sure?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, didn't you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Not the entire thing. I fell asleep about 15 minutes in."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. The movie was that good huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, best I've ever seen."
"__MOVIES__ Ha. On serious note it was a prequel to the original film. The director even commented on it."
"__MOVIES__ What did he say?"
"__MOVIES__ He said the film was originally suppose to be a full on remake, but he would consider it an insult to try and recreate an already great film."
"__MOVIES__ That is interesting. So how did it turn out to be a prequel?"
"__MOVIES__ He basically begged the studio to change it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow he must of been a big fan of the original."
"__MOVIES__ The orginal is a cult classic and in my opinion should never be reinvented. The director feels the same way."
