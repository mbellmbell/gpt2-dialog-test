"__DISNEY__ I have always been a big fan of Disney movies, either animated or live action. How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely. To be honest, I don’t know many people who aren’t fans."
"__DISNEY__ Do you have a favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably The Lion King. I loved that movie growing up."
"__DISNEY__ What about that movie really stood out to you?"
"__DISNEY__ Not only was it just a great family movie, it had an amazing voice cast, and just a great story."
"__DISNEY__ I absolutely agree. I also felt it had some darker elements for a Disney movie, which makes it a bit more appealing to adults."
"__DISNEY__ That is true, also. The story had some adult elements, which I think was a risk that paid off."
"__DISNEY__ And this goes without saying, but, the sequels did not live up to the original?"
"__DISNEY__ Unfortunately, no, I just didn’t think the spark was there."
