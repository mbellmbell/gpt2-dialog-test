"__COMEDY__ Man, I was so tired this morning I almost lost my car!"
"__COMEDY__ That reminds me of the movie Dude Where's My Car."
"__COMEDY__ That movie sounds so stupid. What is it about?"
"__COMEDY__ It's about what you just said. A guy wakes up delirious and loses his car."
"__COMEDY__ Alright, I will admit that sounds kind of interesting."
"__COMEDY__ It is. It's got everything. Time travel, kidnapping, and bullies."
"__COMEDY__ Those are three of my favorite things in movies."
"__COMEDY__ Me too. You have to have some conflict for a movie to be interesting."
"__COMEDY__ It sounds wacky, but does that plot at least make sense?"
"__COMEDY__ It does. While it is childish, there are many life lessons to be learned in Dude Where's My Car"
