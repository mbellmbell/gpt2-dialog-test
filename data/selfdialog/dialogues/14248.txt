"__HORROR__ Name your favorite horror movie?"
"__HORROR__ I don't like horror movies."
"__HORROR__ None?"
"__HORROR__ I've seen some but no, I don't like horror movies."
"__HORROR__ Wait a minute. Didn't you say you're a big fan of The Walking Dead?'"
"__HORROR__ Yes, I am. My wife finds that hilarious too I like zombie shows and zombie movies."
"__HORROR__ But you don't like horror movies? How is that possible?"
"__HORROR__ I don't know. I guess I like watching people kill zombies, or zombies kill people but I don't like seeing people kill people."
"__HORROR__ That's just wierd."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, I guess it is. But that's the way I am. I've dislike horror movies since I was a kid. I only saw my first zombie movie about ten years ago though."
