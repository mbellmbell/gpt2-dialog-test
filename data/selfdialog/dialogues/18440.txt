"__MOVIES__ What's your go-to movie?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Like, is there a movie you just have to watch every year? To get it out of your system."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe Forrest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, why that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm from Alabama, so it's a special movie to me."
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that."
"__MOVIES__ It just reminds me of home."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Forrest Gump really is a great movie. Tom Hanks is great in it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. What about you? Do you have a go-to?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I have some holiday movies. Like Die Hard or Home Alone at Christmas."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, I get that."
"__MOVIES__ And every once in a while, I just have to watch The Emperor's Club."
"__MOVIES__ The Emperor's Club? I don't think I've ever heard of that."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't a big movie. Kevin Kline stars in it."
"__MOVIES__ Huh. I can't even really picture him."
"__MOVIES__ It's about a teacher at a boarding school who bends the rules to encourage a student, who betrays him."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Want to watch it together?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, how about next week?"
