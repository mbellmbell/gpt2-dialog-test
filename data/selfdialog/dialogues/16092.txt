"__ROCK__ Hey, you! With the feet attached to legs! You like Bowie?"
"__ROCK__ He's alright I guess. Why are you bothering me?"
"__ROCK__ What's your song? I need to know NOW."
"__ROCK__ I don't know. I don't have one. I like Bob Seger. I really like 'Against the Wind'."
"__ROCK__ Really? Here's a question for you: name his first Top 40 song. I'll give you help. It wasn't recorded with the Silver Bullet Band but with an earlier group--Bobby S. and the Fancy Boys."
"__ROCK__ Get the heck outta here. No such thing. And I mean it, get out of here."
"__ROCK__ So a Seger dude, huh? Then you must like Canned Heat too, am I right? Gooooing up to country blahie blah blah blah...."
"__ROCK__ Oooh, look at the time and there's my bus and I think my wife's water just broke. I gotta go."
"__ROCK__ Listen to the Bowie! Listen, I say, listen!"
"__ROCK__ He's dead! Get over it!"
