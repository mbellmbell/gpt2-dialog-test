"__MUSIC__ Do you know when Nine Inch Nails are going to release new music?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. It's suppose to be pretty soon."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's what their Facebook said a few months ago."
"__MUSIC__ If I had to guess - maybe 2018?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably a smart guess."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I don't see them releasing anything within the next 5 months of this year."
"__MUSIC__ Same. Especially since they're playing a few festivals the remainder of the year."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Which is interesting actually with no new music."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe they'll play a couple new tracks. Get the internet speculating a little."
"__MUSIC__ Wouldn't be a terrible idea actually."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Then release them officially early next year."
"__MUSIC__ I like your thinking my friend."
"__MUSIC__ Trent knows how to play the market. Plus you never know with NIN."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, remember The Slip? Came out of nowhere overnight!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that shocked me."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you never know these days."
"__MUSIC__ The joys of uncertainty!"
"__MUSIC__ The good and the bad!"
"__MUSIC__ I guess life as well as music would be boring with stability."
"__MUSIC__ In the long run it would be. I agree."
