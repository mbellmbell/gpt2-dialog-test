"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you hear Lady Gaga's new song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Which one is that?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It's called The Cure. She sang it live at Coachella and it's just kind of blown up."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I haven't heard it.  I really liked A Million Reasons though from her album Joanne."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I feel like this may be her time to come back.  She came out with a bang in the late 2000s with The Fame but then she kind of fizzled out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ You didn't like Born This Way or Artpop?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, none of the songs were very catchy.  The only catchy song was Born This Way."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I really liked Applause but you're right, there weren't as many stand alone hits."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I heard she did a jazz album at some point.  I'll have to check that out but I don't really like jazz."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I listened to one or two songs.  It was pretty good."
