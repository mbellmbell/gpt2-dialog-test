"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Poets of the Fall?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not familiar."
"__MUSIC__ Sure you are, they did the in-game music for Alan Wake."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they're the Old Gods of Asgard?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's the name they went by in the game."
"__MUSIC__ What else have they done?"
"__MUSIC__ They did a big cover of 'You Know My Name' a while back."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the James Bond song, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, too bad about Chris Cornell."
"__MUSIC__ May he rest in peace."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but anyways, they did that, and before that they also did a song for Max Payne 2."
"__MUSIC__ So it sounds like they do a lot of game music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, just the two, but they've been around since 2003 or so, and have released several albums since then."
"__MUSIC__ I see. Where are they from?"
"__MUSIC__ Finland, actually, like Nightwish."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard of Nightwish. Are they similar?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. Nightwish has more of a orchestral, harmonic metal sound similar to Within Temptation though a bit harder edged. While Poets are more alt or prog rock."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I did not understand any of that, but it sounds good!"
"__MUSIC__ Just listen to Twilight Theater or Revolution Roulette. I think those are their best albums. You might like them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, alright, if you insist. I'll try to look for those on Spotify at some point."
