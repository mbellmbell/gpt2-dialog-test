"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars movies are much better now that Disney has taken over."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think is better?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The three made before were just bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Can you be more specific."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure: the actors were bad, the characters were awful, the plotlines were bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ I see.  What is better about Disney's versions?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They went  back to the original characters and stories."
"__STAR_WARS__ I suppose I can see your point. What else?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They are more true to the original three movies, as far as storylines."
"__STAR_WARS__ I will have to go see the newer ones, as I haven't yet."
