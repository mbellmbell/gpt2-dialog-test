"__MUSIC__ Who has been your favorite to see in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I think for me it is between Michael jackson or the killers."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, Both great artists but I think michael jackson would be much better to see live."
"__MUSIC__ Well I was really young at the time, but still really enjoyed it . It was the bad tour."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow , what a show to have seen."
"__MUSIC__ It really was, I still recall all the lights and the roar of the crowd was crazy loud."
"__MUSIC__ How can The killers be in the same arena even?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I think because they are now one of my favorite bands. I was older seeing them and a smaller venue."
"__MUSIC__ Small venues can make all the difference, how small are we talking here?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it was a cincinnati casino show. It is an outside stage but it is small so you end up super close even in the back."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good, but I would want it to be a closet small to compete with michael."
"__MUSIC__ Alright jackson's concert will go down in history as the best for me, but killers was a close second. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Favorite to see in concert would be paul simon, graceland tour."
"__MUSIC__ I love paul simon."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, my parents took me to this concert when I was young. It was so cool to see the tribe perform with him."
"__MUSIC__ Wait there was a tribe ?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes the south africans who were featured on the album actually came on tour. It was very incredible."
"__MUSIC__ You mean Ladysmith Black Mambazo?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I think that is their name. I was really young at the time. but still goes down as the greatest for me."
"__MUSIC__ Funny how impactful those first memories can be in your mind."
