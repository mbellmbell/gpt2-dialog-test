"__STAR_WARS__ You know what the main theme of Star Wars is, when all films are taken as a whole?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't, but I'm sure you'll tell me."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's about the change. The rise and fall of governments and power."
"__STAR_WARS__ Alright, I'm listening. Go on."
"__STAR_WARS__ In the prequel trilogy, we have the Galactic Republic fighting against the Separatist Alliance. Who are the Separatists but proto-rebels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ But the Separatists are the bad guys?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Are they? The Republic becomes the Empire, and the Separatists are fighting what they see to be a corrupt institution."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you're saying they become the Rebel Alliance just as the Republic becomes the Empire?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, those remnants form into part of the Rebel Alliance, just as the Imperial Remnants later become The First Order."
"__STAR_WARS__ And the Rebellion becomes the New Republic. I guess it is all about the rise and fall of different organizations, and how one leads to another."
