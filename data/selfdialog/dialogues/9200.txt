"__BASEBALL__ Is Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner still on the DL?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure is.  They've been saying that he won't be back in the game until after the All-Star Game.  But I just read an article that says that he is rehabbing with them in St. Louis and might be back on the field as early as June 1."
"__BASEBALL__ How's Cueto doing?  Is he their number one now?"
"__BASEBALL__ Pretty much.  Cueto is Cueto.  Did you read about the dustup on the field at the Giants-Dodgers game a few days ago?"
"__BASEBALL__ The fight?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yea, the fight.  Cueto thought Grandahl was stealing signs, and they started mouthing off to each other.  Finally, Cueto pitched at Grandahl and narrowly missed his chin.  That cleared the benches."
"__BASEBALL__ Did anyone get thrown out?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't think so.  But Grandahl told the press that they worked it out, apologized to each other, and it's over and done with."
"__BASEBALL__ How's the new kid, Christian Arroyo, doing?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's doing great.  He looks like one of the Dead End Kids.  He's only 21 and can hit anything.  But that will all change as he gets older and the pitchers start to get him."
"__BASEBALL__ True.  What position does he play?"
"__BASEBALL__ He plays third base.  He's from Tampa."
"__BASEBALL__ Is Jeremy Affeldt still in the pitching roster?"
"__BASEBALL__ No.  He's actually broadcasting the Giants games with Mike Krukow and Duane Kuiper.  He's pretty good.  It's nice to hear his little asides about the team.  He can read the signs the pitcher puts down and can explain Bochy's thinking from play - to - play."
"__BASEBALL__ Did the Giants beat Kershaw in the latest Giants-Dodgers series?  How did Kershaw do?"
"__BASEBALL__ The game which Kershaw pitched was the only one in the series which the Dodgers won.  That was the same game in which Cueto and Grandahl went at it."
"__BASEBALL__ Who else is pitching for the Giants without Bumgarner there?"
"__BASEBALL__ Matt Cain, Ty Blach, Hunter Strickland. I want to see Lincecum again."
"__BASEBALL__ Me, too.  I miss the guy.  I wonder if he'll ever be able to pitch in the major leagues again."
"__BASEBALL__ The Angels got rid of him.  I hope he returns to baseball before he gets too old."
