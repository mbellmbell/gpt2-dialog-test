"__POP__ Lady Gaga seems to have declined in recent years with her hits."
"__POP__ She definitely hasn't been churning out hits like she used to."
"__POP__ She's still on the scene, I suppose. She did the super bowl halftime show last year."
"__POP__ Was surprising there wasn't a controversy surrounding her during that show."
"__POP__ For sure. She sometimes does things to get attention."
"__POP__ Her music videos sure screamed attention and look at me."
"__POP__ She's definitely a great artist. A little bit out of left field some times."
"__POP__ For sure. She was always compared to Madonna, who also did some racy things as well."
"__POP__ Some say she doesn't sound like Madonna at all. But I see the music and antic comparisons clearly."
"__POP__ Very true. Madonna was ahead of her times. Lady Gaga seems to fit in with the society today."
