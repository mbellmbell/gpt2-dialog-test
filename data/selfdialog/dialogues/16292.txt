"__ROCK__ So who's your favorite rock star?"
"__ROCK__ Well, I don't know if you'd call him a 'rock star' the way you'd say that about Bowie or something, but Roger Waters for sure."
"__ROCK__ From Pink Floyd?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, especially late Pink Floyd. I prefer the Waters-driven melancholic wartorn era of that band."
"__ROCK__ Like what album? I'm only familiar with Dark Side Of The Moon."
"__ROCK__ Yeah that was an earlier one, David Gilmour had alot of input on that one. But The Wall for instance was mostly all Waters."
"__ROCK__ I saw that movie once, couldn't make heads or tails of it."
"__ROCK__ It's a concept album about war, and about Waters himself and how he felt like fame had turned him into a pseudo-fascist."
"__ROCK__ Whoa, I thought the Wall was just a metaphor for closing ourselves off from others"
"__ROCK__ Yeah it was about that too, but that film and album had a definite defiant mean streak to it as well. Top notch rock in my opinion."
