"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Ed Sheeran?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like he might be too overrated."
"__MUSIC__ Are you kidding?? His voice is amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Well I feel like the songs they place of his on the radio are catchy, but just not that great quality wise."
"__MUSIC__ Well you definitely have to listen to his other music, because I would agree the songs on the radio are more overrated than they need to be."
"__MUSIC__ Well what songs should I listen to then?"
"__MUSIC__ I would suggest listening to his new album, divide."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard Shape of You."
"__MUSIC__ But there are so many other amazing songs on the album!"
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there's Galway Girl and Nancy Mulligan for starters."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't even heard of those."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly and those are the even better ones!"
"__MUSIC__ Which song is your favorite from the new album."
"__MUSIC__ Well Supermarket Flowers really is so sweet, but I'd have to say Perfect is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Is that a really pop song?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all, because it's slower.  It feels more meaningful and powerful."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to give it a try, can I borrow your cd?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course! I'll bring it to work tomorrow!"
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, I'm excited to hear a different side of Ed Sheeran."
