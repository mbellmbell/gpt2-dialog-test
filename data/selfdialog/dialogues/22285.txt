"__DISNEY__ What do you think about Disney's evil movie characters?"
"__DISNEY__ I think most of them are brilliant!"
"__DISNEY__ How so? What makes them brilliant?"
"__DISNEY__ It seems like Disney has a way of devoloping these characters so you literally hate them and root for the good guys."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. What specific characters come to mind when you think of Disney villains?"
"__DISNEY__ Cruella De Vil, Ursula, Gaston, Captain Hook, not to mention all of the evil queens!"
"__DISNEY__ Did any specific villains scare you when you were little?"
"__DISNEY__ The Big Bad Wolf was pretty creepy to be honest. Captain Hook was pretty scary too."
"__DISNEY__ Any other Disney villains you can think of?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Randall Boggs from Monsters was pretty awesome, honestly! Reminds me of someone I know!"
