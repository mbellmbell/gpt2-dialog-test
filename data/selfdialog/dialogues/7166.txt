"__LADY_GAGA__ I wonder what Gaga's next era is going to be. What kind of sound her album will have."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I'm hoping she touches back on some dance-pop stuff. She's so good at it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, me too. I get she need to make an album like Joanne, it was good she had the chance. But it just didn't seem to click together."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Like something was missing?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't know. It just didn't seem like a right fit? But a few of her songs do sound very good. But it's like she's a bit lost on her direction."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh right, cause she had that Jazz and Frank Sinatra era."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you hear she's going to be back on American Horror Story?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I didn't! That makes sense, they'd be stupid to not offer her another role. She killed it the last time and won an award for it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly. I wonder what character is going to be, if it's another main character."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't know, I haven't anything. Did they say what the season's theme was?"
