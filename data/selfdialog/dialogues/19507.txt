"__MOVIES__ I'm looking for a good movie to watch this weekend. Do you have any suggestions?"
"__MOVIES__ What type of movie are you looking for? Drama, comedy, family, suspense?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking something funny, maybe a romantic comedy something older would be good."
"__MOVIES__ I love older movies. What older actors do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I love Audery Hepburn, Frank Sinatra and Fred Astaire."
"__MOVIES__ Have you heard of the movie Funny Face?"
"__MOVIES__ No what's Funny Face?"
"__MOVIES__ Funny Face is a 1957 movie staring Audry Hepburn and Fred Astaire.  It's about a unlikely girl becoming a famous model"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good actually do you own it so I could borrow it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes of course I'll loan you Funny Face and My Fair Lady."
"__MOVIES__ Whose in My Fair Lady?"
"__MOVIES__ It is another older movie staring Audrey Hepburn. It was nominated for Oscars and is often referred to as the original Pretty Woman."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good are these movies in black and white or color?"
"__MOVIES__ Both movies are in color."
"__MOVIES__ Ok so I'll take My Fair Lady and Funny Face. Do you have one more?"
"__MOVIES__ Would you like another old one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I think the theme is older classic romantic movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know exactly what you should watch!  Sabrina also starring Audrey Hepburn."
"__MOVIES__ I have heard of that one and have always wanted to watch it. I guess it's a Audrey movie marathon."
"__MOVIES__ Ok I'll bring Funny Face, My Fair Lady and Sabrina over later tonight and drop off."
