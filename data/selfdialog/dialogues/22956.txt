"__DISNEY__ What folktale do you think Disney's going to go for next?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, they just did Moana..."
"__DISNEY__ Hey, it's not all folktales, you know? Alice in Wonderland and Chronicles of Narnia were classic books."
"__DISNEY__ True, true. Still, sometimes it seems like the reason they're redoing them in live action is that they've run out of ideas."
"__DISNEY__ No, they haven't. They've just been doing other things, like Born In China."
"__DISNEY__ Right, their environmental things. They're alright."
"__DISNEY__ I love seeing those baby animals!"
"__DISNEY__ It's kind of interesting how people and animals are so similar."
"__DISNEY__ We are animals, technically."
