"__BASEBALL__ Do you believe Barry Bonds will ever get inducted in the HOF?"
"__BASEBALL__ He probably will at some point."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Some others who were suspected of steroid use made it in."
"__BASEBALL__ Who might that be?"
"__BASEBALL__ Mike Piazza and Jeff Bagwell to name a few."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think it will tarnish the HOF's reputation if some of these other guys get in?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't believe it will. The HOF is not for choir boys, but for outstanding players."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess you have a point. Guys like Bonds and Sosa were dominant even w/o steroids."
"__BASEBALL__ I believe over time people will forget about the other issues and realize how good there were."
"__BASEBALL__ Who is your favorite player of the 'steroid era?'"
"__BASEBALL__ Grifey Jr. by far."
"__BASEBALL__ He is one of my favorites too. Why is he yours?"
"__BASEBALL__ I am a huge Mariners fan and watched him in his younger, glory days- so much fun to watch."
"__BASEBALL__ He was definitely infectious with that smile and the way he played."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think he compares to anyone now?"
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe Mike Trout- love watching him play. What about you?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm thinking the same guy- Trout is amazing."
"__BASEBALL__ Shame I don't like his team though."
"__BASEBALL__ Agreed...Go Mariners!!"
