"__MUSIC__ I wonder if Fergie is ever going to release a solo album again."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't hear about her newest album Double Dutchess?"
"__MUSIC__ No. What are you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ She has a new album coming out this summer."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I can't wait!"
"__MUSIC__ I know. I loved her single M.I.L.F. $."
"__MUSIC__ So did I, but I never heard anything about a new album. I'm so excited now."
"__MUSIC__ I can't believe it's been 11 years since her first album was released."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It's crazy to think that The Dutchess came out in 2006!"
"__MUSIC__ That album had so many hits."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I still love listening to Fergalicious and London Bridge."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, and I loved her song Glamorous with Ludacris."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard any of Ludacris' music in a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. He had that hit Runaway Love with Mary J. Blige out around the same time The Dutchess came out."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I remember that song. It was so sad."
"__MUSIC__ I know, but it's so much more meaningful than some of his other songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I can't stand any of the songs on his album Battle of the Sexes."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. I think the only reason people liked them is because they had a good beat."
"__MUSIC__ I will say that I did like all the collabs he had on that album."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. That was a positive aspect of it, too."
