"__MOVIES__ So what kind of movies do you like other than action and comedy?  Do you like horror?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I do like thrillers.  Over the past few years I saw a couple of good ones."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones were they?"
"__MOVIES__ I think The Perfect Guy was good.  It was about a guy who seemed perfect but he was a bad man."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah one of my friends saw that and he said it was really good!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was, and there was a lot of action and suspense and what not."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool.  So the guy, was he a sociopath?"
"__MOVIES__ According to the movie he was 'bipolar deteriorating into psychosis', which could cause people to be prejudiced towards people with issues."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad, my friend is a psychologist and said the same thing."
"__MOVIES__ Aside from that the movie was great though."
"__MOVIES__ How about the other movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The other one was No Good Deed, which starred Idris Alba as the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ He's such a great actor, Idris Albe."
"__MOVIES__ Yes he is, and he was what they called a 'malignant narcissist'.  He killed a lot of people."
"__MOVIES__ Well at least it's a thriller so he gets beaten in the end, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes of course.  That's one of the differences between a thriller and horror I think."
"__MOVIES__ Did you notice anything original about that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well one thing I've never seen before was how they had his point of view sometimes and how they portrayed it."
"__MOVIES__ Really, what was it like?"
"__MOVIES__ Basically while the other person says something critical or nasty to him it sounds really loud and causes him a lot of pain."
