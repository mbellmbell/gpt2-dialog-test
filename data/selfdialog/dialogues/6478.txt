"__STAR_WARS__ I'm really excited for the new Star Wars movie The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think the trailers look good.  I think Disney may be over doing it with Star Wars though."
"__STAR_WARS__ How do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they seem to be coming out every year with the trilogy films."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but the older ones released once a year too until they were done."
"__STAR_WARS__ They also had Rogue One and they're doing a Han Solo movie.  Its just a lot of Star Wars.  I'm afraid they'll do too much."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess you're right.  The prequels were so bad though and I thought The Force Awakens was really good so hopefully they'll continue that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought The Force Awakens was ok.  It was basically a retelling of Episode 4.  The deathstar was just bigger."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I can see that.  I really did like Rey though, as a new jedi she's pretty cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ She was pretty cool.  I guess we'll just have to see if this one is any good."
