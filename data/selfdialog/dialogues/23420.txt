"__DISNEY__ Yea, but what if he was left to keep doing all of his dark magic-"
"__DISNEY__ That would have been a little problematic."
"__DISNEY__ True, but the underworld?!"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know if he would have reformed though."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know he may have been scared into reformity."
