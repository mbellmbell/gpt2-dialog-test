"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ugh, I'm so tired of the Patriots winning everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady forever, baby."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, but he's getting old. This can't possibly continue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He eats like nothing but nuts and seeds. He's going to live forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he's going to die. I think he's just getting too old for football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Age is nothing but a number!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Besides, there are other contenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Uh, the Packers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Come on..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, maybe the Pats will win again. But this can't go on forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who says?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet if the Pats win 3 Super Bowls in a row someone will kneecap Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm surprised nobody has yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's because everyone's scared of Belichick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, maybe Belichick will retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way. He's gonna coach from his deathbed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's not a quitter, that's for sure."
