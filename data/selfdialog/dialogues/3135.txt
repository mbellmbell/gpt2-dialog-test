"__MUSIC__ Uncle Billy can you change the station please."
"__MUSIC__ You don't like K-Earth?"
"__MUSIC__ I used to as a kid, but oldies are just too old now."
"__MUSIC__ I can see what you mean, but the Bee Gees are my favorite, I am gonna leave these guys on for this song."
"__MUSIC__ I do love their greatest hits album, I forgot how many good songs they have."
"__MUSIC__ So you do like oldies!"
"__MUSIC__ I like some old bands, Bee Gees just have a flawless lead vocalist in Barry Gibb."
"__MUSIC__ Barry was the man back in the 70s when I was young!"
"__MUSIC__ I bet he was, when they did the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack they must have been on top of the world."
"__MUSIC__ I remember when that came out, and Night Fever was the best song I'd had ever heard!"
"__MUSIC__ I think Stayin' Alive is a bit overplayed and their other tracks deserve more praise as well."
"__MUSIC__ Well what is your favorite song of theirs?"
"__MUSIC__ It is a hard choice, but Night Fever or How Deep Is Your Love?"
"__MUSIC__ What a heartfelt song to pick, and a heartfelt answer to boot!"
"__MUSIC__ I might actually reconsider for the song Spirits!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, Spirits Having Flown was such an under rated album!"

"__MUSIC__ Of course Brandon, I love that song!"
"__MUSIC__ The melody is so bittersweet, one of the best songs ever written."
"__MUSIC__ It surely is, I am proud of you!"
