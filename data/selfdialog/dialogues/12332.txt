"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey sis, it's almost time for some NFL watching."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh Lord."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's wrong?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That means I won't hear from you again until February."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, you crazy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's True!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is, but you know I love me some football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope your team remembers how to play this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh you got jokes. My Panthers will be just fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Cam gets back in the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was in the game last season, but Luke got hurt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yes that's right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was hurt at the beginning of the season and it went downhill after that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he'll be back this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He will. Plus Olsen is going to help out more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He plays great already. I like that dude."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need more good defense players though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. I haven't seen the new roster yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope your Panthers get far this year."
