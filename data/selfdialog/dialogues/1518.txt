"__MUSIC__ So sad about Chris Cornell"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I saw that in the news, but I don't really know much about him..."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously? He is legendary!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe if you could tell me what he has done."
"__MUSIC__ Sure! He was the lead vocalist for audioslave, Soundgarden, and was also part of Temple of the Dog"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, that rings some bells, did he do that song 'The moon and back'?"
"__MUSIC__ No, you're thinking of someone else. Soundgarden did the song 'Black Hole Sun'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh! That song was on the radio all the time! I love that song!"
"__MUSIC__ That's Cornell's voice, but it's not even his best work."
"__MUSIC__ What would you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, if you like grunge, check out 'Fell on Black Days' and for more upbeat ones try 'The Day I Tried to Live' or 'Spoonman'"
"__MUSIC__ I will check those out."
"__MUSIC__ You may also like 'Rhinosaucer' (at least I do)"
"__MUSIC__ What about the other works, audioslave or Temple of the Dog"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, for Temple of the Dog try 'Say Hello to Heaven' as my favorite song"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard it before actually, what about Audioslave."
"__MUSIC__ The best ones are the fast ones like 'Moth' or 'Shape of Things to Come' but slower pieces are better from his acoustic album."
"__MUSIC__ Which pieces should I look for?"
"__MUSIC__ Try 'Thank You' and my all time favorite 'Like a Stone'"
"__MUSIC__ I will check those out!"
