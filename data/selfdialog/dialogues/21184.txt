"__THRILLER__ Dude I cannot get over the movie Split. I watched it like 3 days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it."
"__THRILLER__ Split? That's the movie with Brad William Henke as the guy with 24 different personalities correct?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes! Like jesus!! I haven't watched an intense movie like this in a long time. Words really cannot describe how I feel about it."
"__THRILLER__ I saw it when it came out in theaters, and had the same reaction you're having now, lasted like 3 weeks for me. It was actually pretty scary."
"__THRILLER__ Those poors girls! I was rooting for them the entire time, I never really lost hope that they wouldn't escape that house until Henke turned into the beast and ate the two girls."
"__THRILLER__ Haha! Omg man, I thought he was full of it until he literally crushed his doctor lady with his bare hands."
"__THRILLER__ Exactly! But the fact he spared the last girls life was so satisfying, the emotional rollercoaster of those last 20 minutes almost gave me a heart attack."
"__THRILLER__ More like the last 5 minutes for me, did you even see Bruce Willis sitting the cafe?!?! Like What!"
"__THRILLER__ You really think I missed that part? I've been reading up the final scene since the movie ended. Word of mouth is that M Night Shyamalan is going to make the sequal to Unbreakbale with the premisis from Split."
"__THRILLER__ I'll believe it when I see it but how epic would that be? M Night Shyamalan is making a serious comeback."
