"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you remember Bad Romance? That was such a great song."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh yeah, Lady Gaga! She's extremely talented with the piano, I love Poker Face."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you know she learned to play the piano when she was four?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No way... But then I can believe it, she's seriously an amazing artist."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah but you know a lot of people judge her for her fashion choices."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Like when she wore that dress made of meat? I have to admit, that was a bit weird."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Artists sometimes do things that a lot of normal people wouldn't. That's just how show business works."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think it has more to do with her personality, but I guess you're right."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Either way, I think we can agree that Lady Gaga has made some excellent music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Too true. I really hope that she comes out with another song like Perfect Illusion soon."
