"__BASEBALL__ Why are the Cubs losing?"
"__BASEBALL__ Almost nobody in the infield is playing up to expectations."
"__BASEBALL__ But Kris Bryant is having a stellar year."
"__BASEBALL__ He certainly is, but Rizzo and Swarber are really is a funk."
"__BASEBALL__ It is the sophomore jinx."
"__BASEBALL__ How about Theo Epstein, though(The Cubs General Manager)"
"__BASEBALL__ He sure is a wunderkind.Speaking of Theo, how are my Red Sox doing?"
"__BASEBALL__ I hear that Sale is outperforming expectations."
"__BASEBALL__ He sure is, amazing! He is leading the AL in strikeouts by a large margin."
"__BASEBALL__ That trade is working out.But, GM Dave Dombrokski also seems to have made some dubious moves."
"__BASEBALL__ Time will tell.Anderson Espinozo was NOT part of that trade.He is a top prospect."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, I was traded even up for that lefty."
"__BASEBALL__ I think you are referring to Drew Pomeranz. I think he is pitching alright."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, he may be 'alright', but that is not good enough."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I agree, and David Price has yet to throw his first pitch of 2017."
"__BASEBALL__ They sure dodged a bullet there.Early reports indicted Tommy John surgery, with a return in mid 2018."
"__BASEBALL__ He really underperformed last year, even though he may have won around 17 games."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, that may be correct, but for 30 million a year, you need to pitch better than he did."
"__BASEBALL__ He easily could have won 20 games, the way the Sox hit behind him."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, and even though I always liked the guy, he threw a real stinker in last year;'s playoff appearance."
