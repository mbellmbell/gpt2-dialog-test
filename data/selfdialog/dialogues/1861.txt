"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to Lars Ulrich's show on Apple Music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't have Apple Music."
"__MUSIC__ Sad! It's show featuring hard rock music which is uncommon these days now that everything is hip-hop or electronic."
"__MUSIC__ Makes sense, he's the drummer for Metallica right?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ So what are some good bands he plays? Did you find any new music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, have you heard of the band Royal Blood?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw a promo for them somewhere, but never listened to them."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they're pretty good. Heavy riffs."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. What other bands do they sound like? What are their influences?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a blues rock sound, but it sounds contemporary not retro."
"__MUSIC__ So not like the Black Keys or some Jack White project?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. The riffs are kind of Led Zeppelin sounding, although the singer is no Robert Plant."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean by 'He's no Robert Plant'?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I don't think the Royal Blood vocalist has the range of Plant."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see. How many good songs are on their latest album? Are they a two hits and the rest filler kind of things? Or all good?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like there are four or five good songs which is not bad considering all the albums that come out with two good singles only."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's pretty good. It might be worth checking out."
"__MUSIC__ The new album is called 'How Did We Get So Dark' I think."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I"
