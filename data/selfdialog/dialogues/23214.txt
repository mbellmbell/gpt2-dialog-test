"__DISNEY__ Hey man, why so sad?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, just a little heartbroken and disappointed."
"__DISNEY__ Why's that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I haven't seen a lot of Disney movies so my best friend was exposing me to everything post late-90s I've missed out on but now she's no longer talking to me."
"__DISNEY__ That's a bummer. Which ones did you two watch so far?"
"__DISNEY__ Lilo & Stitch, Hercules, Atlantis, Treasure Planet, and Mulan was the very last one we watched together."
"__DISNEY__ I'm quite surprised you hadn't seen most of those. Would you like me to recommend some?"
"__DISNEY__ That's what she said. No, really, and yeah I guess."
"__DISNEY__ If you want to see some really enjoyable animated ones like those then I'd recommend Chicken Little, Big Hero 6, and Zootopia. For something more live action... Tomorrowland, McFarland USA, and Into The Woods are absolute must see movies."
"__DISNEY__ She also highly recommended Into The Woods so I think I'll start with it. How can I not with the likes of Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Johnny Depp, James Corden, Richard Glover, Chris Pine, and Tracey Ullman in it?"
