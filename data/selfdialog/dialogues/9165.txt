"__BASEBALL__ Rumors here in Chicago about the Cubs trading to get Quintana from the White Sox."
"__BASEBALL__ Who would the Cubs give up?"
"__BASEBALL__ I dunno, Baez maybe?"
"__BASEBALL__ That sounds light. It'd have to be more than Baez."
"__BASEBALL__ What about Baez plus Happ?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's a start. Still seems like a silly rumor."
"__BASEBALL__ You don't think Quintana would be a fit for the Cubbies?"
"__BASEBALL__ You can always use good starting pitching, it's rare. This just seems like a rumor for rumor's sake."
"__BASEBALL__ I've heard it from a couple different places though and it would make some kind of sense."
"__BASEBALL__ It seems more like local media trying to make a local rumor because it sells newspapers."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe, but I'm just thinking about the possibilities."
"__BASEBALL__ Besides that, why would the Cubs trade Baez in the middle of the season?"
"__BASEBALL__ I was just using Baez as an example because he seems to be one of the guys always being asked for by other teams."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't really think of a sensible match for the Cubs to trade away if this were true."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe Happ, Eloy, and some others plus cash $."
"__BASEBALL__ That's more feasible I think, but if White Sox make Quintana available other teams could probably put together better offers."
"__BASEBALL__ If the Cubs want him, there's not too many other teams that have the prospect farm to match us."
"__BASEBALL__ Well then you're paying a premium if you really put the pedal down on a deal. Is Quintana really a guy worth draining the resources for?"
"__BASEBALL__ You said yourself that the pitching market was thin. I think any capable arm is going to demand a nice ransom at this point."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but even in a thin market there's a limit that would produce negative returns if you give up too much for too little."
