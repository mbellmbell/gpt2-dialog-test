"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the last NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In general I think it was pretty disappointing, especially the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree; there should be more variation in the teams making the playoffs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The regular season wasn't all that great, either, for just about any team"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, unless you're a Patriots fan, and even then you get four games without Brady"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not that that made much of a difference for their win percentage"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you really can't argue with the end result, even if you're a fan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots fans will always find something to complain about, even after a historic win that shatters about ten different streaks"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess there's no satisfying some NFL fans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really enjoy the sport in general, but seeing the same teams win and same teams lose every year is tiring"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was strange seeing the Bengals miss the playoffs for the first time in several years"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have been more surprised to see them win a playoff game, to be honest"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The AFC North ended in bitter disappointment, with the Ravens outshined by the Steelers, and then the Steelers getting crushed by the Pats"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You really can't depend on the Steelers when it really matters"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think if the Steelers are going to knock the Ravens out of the playoffs, the least they can do is put up a fight against the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots rivals seem to be just about everyone else at this point"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the rest of the league will loosen up once Brady and Belichick are gone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which, with any luck, will be very soon"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And with Ben Roethlisberger nearing retirement, it will be harder for the Steelers to make repeat appearances"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's about time for some parity in the AFC already!"
