"__MOVIES__ When did movies get really good for you?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Is there a certain point where you feel filmmaking really hit a stride or something?"
"__MOVIES__ Something really seemed to change in the '60s."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ It seems like that's when it started getting more acceptable to make something realistic on a wider scale in Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. Where might that have started?"
"__MOVIES__ Who knows? It was probably pretty gradual. The studio system, which was huge in the '40s, really messed things up, honestly."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah? The Golden Age of Hollywood?"
"__MOVIES__ For sure. For all the praise, it's like there were 3 types of men and 2 types of women in just about all of them."
"__MOVIES__ But not ALL, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Orson Welles had his vision even then, but it's like there were only a few 'sets' of mannerisms actors had."
"__MOVIES__ What might have changed that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you'd see it here and there in older movies. I don't want to ring this bell too loudly."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. 12 Angry Men comes to mind."
"__MOVIES__ Now, that is an example of variety in characters on a few levels."
"__MOVIES__ I often half-jokingly say that pre-Bullitt Hollywood didn't tell stories that well; it was too censored, and things weren't as intense as they were in real life."
"__MOVIES__ Let alone MORE intense, or at least romanticized in some way."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. That one really was a precursor in a lot of ways for action movies, especially the rogue cop thing. That was not huge pre-1968."
"__MOVIES__ They didn't go out of there way to give you a sense of speed in car chases in the '40s. That's for sure."
