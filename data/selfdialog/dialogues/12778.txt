"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What teams do you think will be in the Superbowl this upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to tell. There are a lot of good teams and injuries can change things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, but if you had to take a guess."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I would go with the safe choice, the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Patriots? Really? Tom Brady is about to turn 50 isn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he will turn 40 this upcoming season and he still looks as good as ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know you are probably right about the Patriots being in the Superbowl but I just don't like them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The last Superbowl against the Falcons was an amazing game. They are fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt that game was amazing. It has to be one of the most historic NFL games ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For the Patriots to come back from a 25 point deficit was one of the greatest things I have ever seen in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the Patriots are good but what other teams do you think could be in the Superbowl next year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Atlanta Falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons? You don't think they were kind of a fluke last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not at all. The team from last year is still in place and they have a good schedule next year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lets hope if they do make it to the Superbowl again they don't embarrass themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they make it back again I don't see any team coming back from a 20 point deficit to beat them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What other teams do you think have a chance to make it to the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys, Chiefs, Raiders, Texans, maybe even the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Texans? You can't be serious?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a great defense. If they can get a decent quarterback they could go all the way."
