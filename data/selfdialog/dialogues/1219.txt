"__MUSIC__ Hey, a group of my friends and I were having a discussion on the best female pop singers of all time. Who would you put up there?"
"__MUSIC__ Well right off the bat you have to consider Beyonce. She was and still is one of the greatest."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah she is okay but I was never really a fan of hers. I always preferred Mariah Carey more than Beyonce."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah she was good to."
"__MUSIC__ I just felt she could do a lot more things than Beyonce."
"__MUSIC__ I would also have to put Taylor Swift up there in that category as well."
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift? She is a country singer not a pop singer."
"__MUSIC__ Well actually now she has become more of a pop singer."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I just don't trust a country singer turned pop singer."
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, she is probably a better pop singer than she was a country singer."
"__MUSIC__ If we are talking about pop singers who are most popular now I would have to go with Katy Perry."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love her. She is a great artist."
"__MUSIC__ Yes she is! What are some of your favorite songs of hers?"
"__MUSIC__ Well of course I would have to say Roar first of all. I also like Firework, Wide Awake, and California Girls."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah those are some of her best. I would have to say Last Friday Night is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I like that one a lot and I love to watch the video for it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah her videos are all really great and usually they have a funny side to them."
"__MUSIC__ I think we should go and watch some of her videos now."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Which one should be first?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's go with Last Friday Night!"
