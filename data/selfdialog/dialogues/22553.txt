"__DISNEY__ There are some days when I feel like Tarzan."
"__DISNEY__ Great film but what do you mean."
"__DISNEY__ You know sometimes you find yourself in a jungle in just a loincloth."
"__DISNEY__ What with a beautiful lady named Jane, a pack of gorillas and Phil Collins singing love songs."
"__DISNEY__ Ha ha, yeah something like that. It is such a good film though."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I heard they were making a sequel."
"__DISNEY__ No way, when's it out."
"__DISNEY__ Not too sure, just saw some rumours on the internet."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they make a sequel."
"__DISNEY__ If they do, you'd be ready made to play the elephant. Ha ha."
