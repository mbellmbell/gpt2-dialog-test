"__MOVIES__ The very first  film that used the stop motion animation was?"
"__MOVIES__ That can't be the real question, let me see the card."
"__MOVIES__ no that's what it says. I'm not giving you my card."
"__MOVIES__ I just want to see it and make sure... Ok fine. So the first stop motion animation was back in 1897. Humpty Dumpty Circus. But what is the most commercially successful stop motion animation?"
"__MOVIES__ How should I know? I'm not the film historian."
"__MOVIES__ it was a rather ercent film given the history of Stop motion animation. It's Chicken Run from 2000. It grossed over 224 million world wide."
"__MOVIES__ That's even more than Tarantino's the Hateful Eight."
"__MOVIES__ Oh. Gee look. You can compare numbers."
"__MOVIES__ HarHar. how does that compare to the most successful film, period?"
"__MOVIES__ You mean 'commercially successful,' well, the film that rakes more money that any other films from the box office, not including dvd sales etc, is, drum roll please,  Avatar at $2.7 billion."
"__MOVIES__ No way,. Avatar? I wouldn't have thought that. That movie sucked."
"__MOVIES__ You also think French films and Japanese animes suck."
"__MOVIES__ True, and I do have many well informed opinions on the matter, but Avatar? The entire thing was computer generated. At what point does a film stop being a film involving actors, and become just a computer generated images?"
"__MOVIES__ Avatar is nowhere near being just a computer generated film. Besides, computer animation is an art form on its own merit."
"__MOVIES__ That's laughable. No way computer animation is an art form. The computer is doing all the animating, drawing etc"
"__MOVIES__ But that's so not true. It takes incredible amont of skill as an artist to produce figures using computers, and to animate them takes a lot of skills often a lot of programming."
"__MOVIES__ You said an art form. Programming is not an art."
"__MOVIES__ Programming is an art form if you make it out to be..."
"__MOVIES__ That's such a nonsense. it's a spin-off of the typical 'art is everywhere' nonsense. Honestly, woudl you pay for an art made and produced by a computer?"
"__MOVIES__ I most certainly would. and there already are many computer artists, or artists who use the computer not just for making the content of art, but computer as a part of the art itself."
