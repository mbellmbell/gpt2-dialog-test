"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah it is a little alarming, but someone else always seems to set up"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah so far so good, but I'm worrried about the Justin Schulz injury."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah he is a vital cog in their success"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I just hope that they are able to overcome this latest injury"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, when you still have Sidney Crosby, you still have a great chance"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Very true. Crosby definitely gives them an advantage"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And the Senators really don't have anyone on their squad that compares"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah you are right, but the Senators are playing well right now"
