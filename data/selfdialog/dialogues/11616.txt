"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about dem Browns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ what about them, they are always terrible anymore"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it is like spring training."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ sure, no losing record yet at least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude,they are getting better"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ really, they say that ever year, and the pftttt"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look they have like a zillion new draft picks , high one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't have a quarterback still."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ they have a couple guys who could be OK"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a couple rookies and a veteran, just like last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns didn't waste any time getting guys who got hyped up like the last two years at least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, If I ever hear anybody say 'Johnny Football' I'll punch em."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, that's to funny like nobody could see how that was going to play out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nobody wants to play here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, this coaching staff  is getting me a little more confident."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But nobody gets to stay more than a couple years, they can never even get their program of the ground before they are fired."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they learned that lesson finnaly, a couple of those coaches were victims of stupid front office and owner moves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That owner is an idiot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He probably is, but he seems to have backed off telling the football guys what to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, he must get embarrassed owning a team that literally everybody else points to as a way not to do things."
