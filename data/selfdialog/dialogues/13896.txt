"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the playoffs between the Golden State Warriors and the Spurs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. It was an amazing game.  The Warriors out played them."
"__BASKETBALL__ I couldn't believe Steph Curry and Kevin Durant's performance. Did you see that dunk in the first period by Durant?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. He just blew in and dunked the ball as if no one was there."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't believe how many 3 pointers Steph Curry hit."
"__BASKETBALL__ He just amazes me how he can hit those shots as if he was a foot away from the basket."
"__BASKETBALL__ I couldn't believe Green's performance coming off the bench."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. He is without a doubt the best sixth player they have."
"__BASKETBALL__ Remember how they lost the series last year when Green wasn't able to play in that playoff game.  He is a clutch player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Could you believe how the Warriors ran up the points during the game.  They really outplayed the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can't wait to see the series final when they play the Cleveland Cavaliers again this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ It should be an amazing re-match in the finals. Both teams are on their game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron is such a super star. They have a great bench too for backup."
"__BASKETBALL__ However, the Warriors have Steph, Durant and Green.  This should make this an amazing match-up."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm forecasting that this year the Cavs will take the series 4 games to 2."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure.  The Warriors are so good and want revenge this year. I bet it will come down to the final game."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree both have strong offense and defense. However, the edge probably goes to the Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ The defense is probably stronger for the Warriors when they are on their game.  Right now they are hot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well it will be interesting to watch the series and see how it plays out. How about a bet on this game. I'll take the Cavs."
"__BASKETBALL__ You got it. I'll take the Warriors that they will win the finals."
