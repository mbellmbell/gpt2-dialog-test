"__MOVIES__ I've only seen Totoro but I loved it! It was such a cute film."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I'm not sure which one to watch though."
"__MOVIES__ I wish I could make a suggestion but I've only seen one Studio Ghibli film."
"__MOVIES__ I think I'm going to watch Kiki's Delivery Service."
"__MOVIES__ What's that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a witch who turns 13 years old and goes off on her own."

"__MOVIES__ It's one of my favorites and the first Studio Ghibli film I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ I really want to watch that one now!"
"__MOVIES__ You definitely should! You will not be dissappointed."
