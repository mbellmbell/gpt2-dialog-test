"__MUSIC__ I was thinking about that movie La Bamba the other day. I really like that early rock music."
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of that guy who played in that movie?"
"__MUSIC__ The actor was Lou Diamond Phillips but the real musician was Ritchie Valens."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't he die in a car accident?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it was actually a plane crash that killed him right at the height of his recording career."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's right! He died at the same time as Buddy Holly! Those guys were legends in Rock and Roll."
"__MUSIC__ It's interesting that he took a traditional Mexican folk song and put it together with new rhythms to make La Bamba."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder why he chose Mexican folk music to work with."
"__MUSIC__ Well he was of Mexican heritage. His real name was Richard Valenzuela."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that. Maybe I did and just forgot."
"__MUSIC__ I bet you knew it if you saw the movie La Bamba. He had other hit songs too."
"__MUSIC__ I can't think of any. Do you know the names of any of them?"
"__MUSIC__ Come On, Let's Go was one of them but I don't really like that one."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't there one about a girl too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it was called Donna. In the movie that was his girlfriend's name but I don't know if that is fact or fiction."
"__MUSIC__ I hope it's fiction because otherwise that would really be sad. That would mean she had to deal with his death as a young woman."
"__MUSIC__ The whole world had to deal with his death! Did you know the day he died is known as The Day the Music Died?"
"__MUSIC__ What date is that?"
"__MUSIC__ It was February 3, 1959."
"__MUSIC__ I think there was a song called American Pie that talked about The Day the Music Died. That is just so sad."
