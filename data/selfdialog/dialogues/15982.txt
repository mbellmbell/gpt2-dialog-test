"__ROCK__ What do you think of the old school prog scene?"
"__ROCK__ Like Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Yes, all of that?"
"__ROCK__ Yeah, those are good examples of old school, high-concept prog."
"__ROCK__ I love it - I like the theatrical elements and odd and eclectic compositions"
"__ROCK__ Definitely. I always liked Rush myself, especially the really early stuff like 2112."
"__ROCK__ Yeah me too. 2112 is a classic. Never felt the synth era though, around Signals."
"__ROCK__ Yeah the synth era was pretty different from the early stuff - I like guitar-based music in general so I agree with you"
"__ROCK__ If it doesn't have noisy, dissonant guitar noise all over the place, it's not my kinda prog music"
"__ROCK__ Ha, I hear that - I like music like that for the journey and I think dissonance and resolution are big parts of that."
"__ROCK__ I agree - progressive music is all about trying new things, breaking out of what's been established and moving forward."
