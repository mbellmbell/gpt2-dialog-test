"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the newest Star Wars cast?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved Natalie Portman in it, she was so awesome as Padme."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree! And what about Kiera Knightly? Those two together are just a dynamic duo."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Carrie Fisher as the classic Princess Leia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She was amazing. It's such a shame what happened."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, but her spirit lives on in each and every Star Wars movie to come."
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutely. George Lucas knew what he was doing when he cast her in the original. It was an amazing choice."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that he had to get some inspiration from Akira Kurosawa?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?! I had no idea. That makes sense though. I can see how it gave it a more personable feel."
"__STAR_WARS__ Absolutely! And with a ten million dollar budget, they had to make sure it was great!"
