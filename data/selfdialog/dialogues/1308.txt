"__MUSIC__ So do you ever listen to the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ Very rarely..."
"__MUSIC__ Why not?"
"__MUSIC__ Most of it is so bland and boring."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean.  I heard that the language and complexity has been devolving over the years."
"__MUSIC__ It must be from what I'm hearing..."
"__MUSIC__ You must like something?"
"__MUSIC__ Taylor Swift writes some good songs...and I like Sia a little."
"__MUSIC__ I know a few of each of their songs but not much.  How about the new Gwen Stefani album?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard any of the songs on the radio but there are a few good tunes."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she dedicate it to her new boyfriend?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but I can't recall his name.  I know he's a country singer and they're both on The Voice..."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really watch that but I do like the album."
"__MUSIC__ It was just alright for me.  Why do you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was so dance-able!"
"__MUSIC__ That really is her wheelhouse!  She also has quite an alluring voice."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, there's something so sensual about it."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed.  I'll have to give it another listen."
"__MUSIC__ She looks so young too!"
"__MUSIC__ I know!  I hope I look that good at her age!"
