"__MUSIC__ Man who is Leona Lewis?"
"__MUSIC__ What makes you ask that?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm listening to this song of hers."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ Which one, I never heard of her. Bleeding Love. Does she have more?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I know Bleeding Love though."
"__MUSIC__ I think I might have to add this to my library."
"__MUSIC__ You should just google her and see if she has more songs out."
"__MUSIC__ I know right."
"__MUSIC__ That's how I get most of my music. I hear something hot, then I check to see if the artist has more."
"__MUSIC__ But then when you find more you have to listen to them to see if they are any good."
"__MUSIC__ Something like that."
"__MUSIC__ I just googled her and she has songs out from like 2007."
"__MUSIC__ That's when she did Bleeding Love. What, you thought that was new?"
"__MUSIC__ Well yeah. I guess it's new to me."
"__MUSIC__ I think she may have a couple of albums or cd's out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think I will go on youtube and hear some more. She has a nice voice."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah she does."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard Fire Under My Feet?"
"__MUSIC__ Well that's a track she did last year."
