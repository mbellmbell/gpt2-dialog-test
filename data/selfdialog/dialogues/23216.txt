"__DISNEY__ It looks like they're making a live action version of Disney's The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ That should be interesting to see. I wonder how they'll create the 'under the sea' look."
"__DISNEY__ Not sure, but I hope they keep it pretty true to the original, not like the upcoming remake of Mulan."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know how I feel about this, though. The live shows they've been doing on TV of musicals haven't been that great."
"__DISNEY__ I am hoping that, at the very least, I can enjoy the music."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if they'll add any new songs."
"__DISNEY__ Like in the new Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that would be awesome! Maybe have Eric sing something."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if the animals will be puppets or animated?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, but it will be interesting to see how they do Ursula!"
