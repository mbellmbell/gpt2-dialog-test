"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but they not all 'good' movies."
"__MOVIES__ True. Did you see Snakes on a Plane?"

"__MOVIES__ In theory, but I veiwed it more as a spoof."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean."
"__MOVIES__ It hit all the action movie cliches. It was great!"

"__MOVIES__ I disagree, if you look at it from the spoof angle."
"__MOVIES__ I never really liked spoofs."
