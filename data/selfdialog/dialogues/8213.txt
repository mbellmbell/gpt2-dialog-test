"__POP__ Hey, was just jamming out to Paul Simon's 'Graceland' album. Have you heard it?"
"__POP__ Yes, I think so. Wasn't there a song on it called, 'Diamonds on the Souls of her Shoes?'"
"__POP__ Yes, that one is good. There's a lot of great music on that album. Wonder what Paul Simon is producing now?"
"__POP__ He married Eddie Brickell. She had that hit 'What I Am' a hundred years ago. Good tune."
"__POP__ Wonder if the two of them every made albums together. I always liked 'What I am.'"
"__POP__ Great dance tune. Art Garfunkel, I think he's been out of music for a very long time... I think Garfunkel wasn't happy with Simon."
"__POP__ Simon did go on to be very successful. Wonder what the Police think of Sting now."
"__POP__ Yes, he clearly went on to fame and creativity musically. Sting's solo albums are some of his best work."
"__POP__ Sting really matured into amazing talent, for sure. He's been relevant for a long time musically."
"__POP__ His songs tend to be sad and melancholy though. Remember 'Wrapped Around Your Finger?'"
