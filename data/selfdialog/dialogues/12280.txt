"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the Falcons this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a long season. But I think they'll get at least through the first round of the playoffs. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's rough. Competition gets harder. But if Matt Ryan's healthy. I think they have a shot of getting back to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. He was on fire in the playoffs. No picks. What? Seven touchdowns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Something like that. The problem may still be the D-line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Even with the off-season pick-ups."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No matter what, it'll be cool to play in the new stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mercedes-Benz?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. I mean, that thing is going to be great. Retractable roof and all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I'm going to try to get to a home game, for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think about retiring Vick's jersey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm okay with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me, too. I feel like the haters who want to punish him forever. That's just not right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Plus, you know, he just electrified Atlanta. Outside the dog stuff, you know, he was good for football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, running QBs definitely make the game for exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. I cringe every time one takes off, because, you know, the risk of injury seems so high for these guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. But that's part of what makes it so exciting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then you've got folks like Roethlisberger who just sit in the pocket and take on all comers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a beast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Funny. For sure, but I'll always judge him worse than I do Vick."
