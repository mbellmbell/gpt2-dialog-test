"__THRILLER__ I love the movie Psycho with the Norman Bates character. Have you seen it?"
"__THRILLER__ I have, actually, yes. But it was a long time ago and I don't remember a whole lot about it."
"__THRILLER__ Does the phrase 'Shower scene' ring any bells?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, definitely. That's one of the greatest horror scenes in movie history!"
"__THRILLER__ Besides that scene, one very interesting aspect of that movie is definitely Norman Bates himself."
"__THRILLER__ He is definitely a unique character. That's for sure."
"__THRILLER__ I've always liked how he is so unconvincing. He naturally comes off like a nice and charming guy."
"__THRILLER__ That's one thing that probably makes the movie a classic horror film. A character that while he is insane, is still a believable one."
"__THRILLER__ Do you think it should be remade again?"
"__THRILLER__ Absolutely not. Some horror films just should not be re-done, even though this one was back in 1998."
