"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see that movie called The Imitation Game?"
"__MOVIES__ No I haven't, though I've heard a bit about it."
"__MOVIES__ It's really good, you should see it sometime."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about again?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a quirky guy back in World War I who is really smart."
"__MOVIES__ What makes him so smart?"
"__MOVIES__ He's kind of odd, but he's really good with codes and basically invents the first computer."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow! That's a very good movie idea!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I think it is too. The actor they chose is really good too."
"__MOVIES__ Who did they pick?"
"__MOVIES__ Benedict Cumberbatch plays the main guy, and does a great job seeming like the weird genius of the group."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, I like the other movies that he's been in."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's a good actor from the stuff I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ The move itself though is very cleverly directed, and has a lot of LGBT elements to it."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I had no idea."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the main guy is actually gay."
"__MOVIES__ What? That's very cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the movie's gotten a lot of praise for including that element."
"__MOVIES__ Is the movie based on a true story?"
"__MOVIES__ It is actually, though I don't know if he was gay in real life but I'm sure that part was true."
