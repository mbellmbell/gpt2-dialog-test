"__STAR_WARS__ I was looking online at those top ten lists I love so much, and I saw one for Star Wars characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ So who was the number one favorite? Yoda? Chewbacca? Luke Skywalker?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope, none of those. You know how movie-goers love a good villian."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was Darth Vadar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yep, Darth was the number one favorite character."
"__STAR_WARS__ So where did Yoda, Chewbacca, and Luke Skywalker land on the list?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda was 5, Chewbacca was 7, and Luke Skywalker was 3."
"__STAR_WARS__ None of them even made second? So who was second?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Second-Obi Wan Kenobi, fourth Han Solo, sixth R2D2, eighth Boba Fett, ninth Princess Leia, and tenth Darth Maul."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, Princess Leia only ninth? I would have guessed that whole list differently."
