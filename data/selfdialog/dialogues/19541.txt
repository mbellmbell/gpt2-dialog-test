"__MOVIES__ My friend keeps teasing me because I've never seen Dumb and Dumber."
"__MOVIES__ As they should! It's a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. They're both really good in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I'm not sure if that's just me being nostalgic about it though because it's been one of my favourite movies since I was a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Well we'll have to watch it sometime then."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. Then you'll understand the references we make in my family."
"__MOVIES__ Oh boy, I can't wait."
"__MOVIES__ There are a lot of funny scenes in it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not super familiar with Jim Carrey."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, well I thought this was one of his funnier roles. He really plays up his facial expressions and vocal work in it."
"__MOVIES__ Vocal work?"
"__MOVIES__ You'll see what I mean."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the movie the line 'pretty bird' is in that I keep hearing?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. I'm sure once you see it you'll be using it, too."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that there's a sequal called Dumb and Dumber To."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I haven't seen it though, I don't have high hopes for it."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ I just don't think after all these years they'll be able to recreate the same caliber of humor, plus sequels rarely turn out half as good as the originals."
