"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey football season is coming up, are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I love the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Chiefs but thats only because I grew up in Kansas City."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah im that way with the patriots since i grew up in Boston.  Id rather they win but im not super upset if they lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You have Tom Brady though, one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time so that has to feel good!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, its nice but hes not everything.  Its the rest of the team that help make them good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think its interesting how the NFL is so focused on quarterback play and passing now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah i agree, back in the 80s and 90s it was good to have a strong running game, but now theres something like 13 quarterbacks who threw for over 4000 yards last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, look at Eli Manning, hes thrown for over 4k for the last 4 years and has two MVPs and two rings and people still disregard him.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah theres just so much quality in the new guys like dak prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, dallas is going to be set if Dak can keep up with his current play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Id rather have a good quarter back like rogers or stafford than none at all i suppose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats for sure.  I feel bad for the teams like the browns who always are trying to find a new player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of the browns, how do you think that RGIII will do with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will fail just like he has in the past, hes just too frail to play in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you might be right.  Kind of like Tony Romo, so much talent but just incident prone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah then theres guys like peyton manning who has his neck bones fused back together and somehow can come back to win a superbowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, peyton is certainly an inspirational story."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Im glad he was able to get another ring.   I loved him with the colts."
