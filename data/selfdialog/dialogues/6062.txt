"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think about the Star Wars prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they were OK.  Not great, but they are better when you watch them a second time."
"__STAR_WARS__ They're better when you watch them at home for free and not having to wait in line to be disasppointed."
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally!  I liked Revenge of the Sith!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did too. I also really liked Natalie Portman."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree.  I feel like the female charcters in the movies are some of the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was kinda awesome for Princes Leia to grow up to be a general."
"__STAR_WARS__ And not just following around Hans Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you looking forward to the new movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  I hope there will be ewoks."
