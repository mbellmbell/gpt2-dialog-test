"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, how ready are you for NFL this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm always excited to watch football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will you be cheering on this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm very loyal to the Kansas City Chiefs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chiefs suck. What do you think about them letting Jamaal Charles go?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They couldn't afford to keep him. He only played a few games last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that knee of his is quite the liability, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yeah it is. I'm glad Denver signed him though. He is a good player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, definitely. Me too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will you be cheering for this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going for the raiders!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah? They are moving their stadium to vegas, aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they are!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any idea why? I thought that was pretty weird."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had been trying to find a new stadium in the Bay Area but just didn't have any luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, their current stadium is pretty old right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's very old and just doesn't bring in the money it needs to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotch'ya. That sucks that they have to move but, I'm sure it will be worth it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they scored and amazing deal for their new stadium!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's great for their team!"
