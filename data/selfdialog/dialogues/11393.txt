"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you seen the crazy money going around the NFL right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeh, can you believe how much that one quarterback got?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that was crazy for sure. Quite a lot of cash."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Something like $150 million right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Close, he's going to get $125 million for 5 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's insane, who is he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's Derek Carr of the Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really know him that well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a good season last year and they want to hang on to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still, that sounds like a lot of money for a guy who's not a household name."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It actually makes him the highest paid NFL player ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're kidding me right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I'm not, it's the most money per year ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he makes more than Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At the current time yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes no sense to me at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, with the Raiders moving in to Las Vegas they need a great team and good leader."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they're moving from Oakland to Vegas? Are you serious?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, they move around more than a Bedouin tribe it seems like."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it should be interesting at least. The Raiders in Vegas, that's a trip."
