"__MUSIC__ You know I saw the Rolling Stones once."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Mick Jagger can't sing the way he sounds on the albums."
"__MUSIC__ I never thought Mick Jagger had a great voice even on those studio recordings."
"__MUSIC__ Well trust me, he sounds a hundred times worse live."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't had the pleasure of going to a concert."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't miss much. I left part way through I was so disappointed."
"__MUSIC__ Well that sucks."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it does, they were my favourite band for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ You can still enjoy their albums though right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I don't mind them, even though they're not my favourite anymore. 'Paint It Black' used to be my favourite song."
"__MUSIC__ I think that's one of their better ones."
"__MUSIC__ On their album it is. You wouldn't be able to make out any of the words live."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a big concert goer anyway, and I don't like them THAT much. I just have a few songs of theirs I really like."
"__MUSIC__ Oh what ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Sound wise, 'Brown Sugar', lyric wise, 'Sympathy For The Devil'."
"__MUSIC__ Your mom always liked Brown Sugar."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I know, I remember her putting it on a mix cd and listening to it all the time. I never knew what the words were until just, like, last year."
"__MUSIC__ There are slightly different versions of it so I hear."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah!"
