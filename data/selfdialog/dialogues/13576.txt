"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Drew Bres is going to catch Peyton Manning's touchdown reccord?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is he, like 74 away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he would have to throw 37 in the next two years to get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's 38 years old though, and he's going to turn 39 during the season. I don't know if he'll do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus his team isn't as good as its been in the past. It might take him three seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady isn't that far beind Bres either, maybe he will break the reccord."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady is a year and a half older though, he would have to play until hes 42 to get it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyone else close to the reccord?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli Manning is the next closest whos playing, but hes pretty far behind. I don't think he has a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Aaron Rodgers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is about three hundred behind. I think missing those years sitting behind Favre is going to cost him a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really improved his game though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, he has the best QB rating of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rivers is right up there with Eli Manning, but he probably won't get it either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's crazy how many people on the TD leaderboard are still playing or just retired in the last 10 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Teams throw a lot more now though, some teams barely run the ball unless they have to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dan Marino played back before all of this and he's pretty high on the list."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did Fran Tarkenton, he had a lot of TD passes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Imagine if those guys played today how many they would have."
