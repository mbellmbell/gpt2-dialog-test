"__MUSIC__ Hey did you ever listen to Aerosmith?"

"__MUSIC__ Stephen Tyler was a true artist.  I wonder what happened to him?"
"__MUSIC__ They're still around, they just don't make music anymore."

"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that was another unique thing about them."
"__MUSIC__ So what were they like in concert?"

"__MUSIC__ I'd love to see them someday."
"__MUSIC__ I think you've missed your chance for that, bro."
