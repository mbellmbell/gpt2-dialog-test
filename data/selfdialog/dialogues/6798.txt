"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that Han Solo's 'I know' line was improvised?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I did read about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes the scene so much cooler."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's impressive how an improvised line ended up being one of the best lines of the franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ It only served to elevate an already incredible and emotional scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ When I first saw Han get frozen in carbonite, I couldn't believe that was how the movie was going to end."
"__STAR_WARS__ I felt the same, though it added to the payoff in the next movie when Leia finally rescued him."
"__STAR_WARS__ If you recall, she even repeated the 'I know' line back to Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a great callback."
"__STAR_WARS__ One of the many reasons why I love the original series so much."
