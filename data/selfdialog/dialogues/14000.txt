"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think the Warriors will pull it off this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so. I think they have the most wins this year right?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. But remember what happened last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavaliers won, barely, and in game 7. The Warriors are better this year though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. First they have to knock out the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Which they will. And the Cavaliers will knock out Boston."
"__BASKETBALL__ I would be shocked if it didn't come down between the Cavaliers and Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ That would be interesting."
"__BASKETBALL__ But it's not going to happen."
"__BASKETBALL__ But anyway, I don't know. we'll see if the Cavaliers have a plan this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know they got Williams now. That's the only thing I see that could be a game changer for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Korver isn't shooting 3's as well as he used to."
"__BASKETBALL__ And maybe Williams will make up for that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Whatever. I'm just glad Williams didn't end up here in Utah. We were considering trading for him."
"__BASKETBALL__ I doubt anyone in Utah wants Williams back. But yeah I heard that was a possibility."
"__BASKETBALL__ We still hold a little bit of a grudge for what he did to Sloan and Hayward."
"__BASKETBALL__ To Hayward? What did Williams do to Hayward?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He was just constantly disrespecting him on the court."
"__BASKETBALL__ Like how? What did he do?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He threw the ball at him, berated him so many times right after each play."
