"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you think Owen and Deckard Shaw will return for the next Fast and Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You mean Luke Evans and Jason Statham's characters?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah I hope those two will return. It's odd that in The Fate of the Furious they became good after all the turmoil from the Furious 7 and the one before."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think they will return. I really liked what they did with Jason Statham's character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me too! I liked that they gave him more action sequences. That whole scene on the plane with the baby was great in Fate of the Furious!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That scene was hilariously over the top but I loved it!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He was even at the lunch at Dom's house at the end!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was a little weird. I get that he helped them because they helped him and his brother but that scene at the end with all of them so happy was a bit off."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think you have to understand it goes back to Dom's loyalty to family and Deckard showing he holds the same value. So they found a common point between them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You're right. I didn't think about that. I think We'll have Deckard returning as part of the crew from here on out."
