"__THRILLER__ I think that the older movies are better.  Have you ever seen Rear Window?"
"__THRILLER__ No I don't think I have.  What's it about?"
"__THRILLER__ James Stewart has two broke legs and is watching his neighbors through binoculars. He thinks one of them killed their wife."
"__THRILLER__ Does he call the police?"
"__THRILLER__ At first, but the guy hid all of the evidence so James Stewart sets out to prove him guilty himself."
"__THRILLER__ How does he do that?"
"__THRILLER__ He gets his girlfriend and his housekeeper to help him.  Grace Kelly plays his girlfriend."
"__THRILLER__ Who plays the bad guy?"
"__THRILLER__ I think it's Orson Wells. It gets really scary because he catches on to being watched and then tries to kill James Stewart."
"__THRILLER__ This sounds like a movie I need to watch!"
