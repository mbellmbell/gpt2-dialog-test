"__MOVIES__ People are always asking me what movies I like but no one ever asks what movies I don't like."
"__MOVIES__ Why would they want to know what movies you don't like?"
"__MOVIES__ I think what a person doesn't like tells as much about them as what they do like."
"__MOVIES__ I see your point. So what movies don't you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't like movies about zombies for one. I went to see The Mummy and was very disappointed that it was more about zombies that mummies."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure I follow you. What's the difference between mummies and zombies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well a mummy is just a dead person that has been preserved either by accident or on purpose."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so zombies are dead people too. Aren't they?"
"__MOVIES__ Zombies are dead people who come back to life. That's just stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't you expect The Mummy to be about dead people?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course, but it was one scene after another of people getting the life sucked out of them and then animating again. I didn't like it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see the older movie called The Mummy? The one with Brendan Fraser?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and I liked it a lot better. There was more of a story and it wasn't about zombies."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I'll have to go see the movie for myself. It's supposed to be scary."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't scary. It was just gross."
"__MOVIES__ Is there any other movie you don't like?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like Forrest Gump. I just couldn't get into it."
"__MOVIES__ Well you're in a minority there because Forrest Gump has a huge following. Don't you like Tom Hanks?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually I think Tom Hanks is a fantastic actor. I just didn't like the movie Forrest Gump."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure what that says about you. I think I'd rather know what movies you like."
