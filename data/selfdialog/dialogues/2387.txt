"__MUSIC__ Have you been to any good concerts lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've been to a few. I just saw Jimmy Eat World at a small venue in West Virginia."
"__MUSIC__ JEW in WV? How big was this place?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was 500 capacity."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's incredible that has to be the smallest show they've played since 'The Middle' blew up several years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's crazy to think that I got to see this once small little emo band that blew up in the mainstream at such an intimate venue again."
"__MUSIC__ I'm incredibly jealous, I'm not a huge fan of them now, but their earlier stuff along with The Get Up Kids and Braid were my jams back in the day!"
"__MUSIC__ Right on! What about you, any good shows lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw Whitney on tour with Natalie Prass last week. It was one of the better shows I've been to."
"__MUSIC__ Whitney... Houston?"
"__MUSIC__ No, haha. Whitney is an indie band featuring two guys from the Smith Westerns."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I loved them! Go on..."
"__MUSIC__ They're an indie pop band, the sound is rooted in 70s pop rock, it's very upbeat, colorful, almost flowery if you will. The set was breathtaking, they were a very tight band in a live setting."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds great, how was the opener?"
"__MUSIC__ Natalie Prass, she was good, but her live performance was lacking. On record her songs are full and boastful, there's some brass instruments behind her beautiful singing, but live it was just a guy on keys and a guitar player."
"__MUSIC__ I hate when bands don't translate well to a live setting! I'm very intrigued by Whitney though. Which record should I check out?"
"__MUSIC__ They only have one so far, it's called 'Light Upon the Lake' -- Pitchfork gave it Best New Music and an 8.3 last year."
"__MUSIC__ Usually Best New Music albums are pretty solid, so I'll pull this up on Apple Music later today."
"__MUSIC__ I think you're going to enjoy it, if you like The Shins, Car Seat Headrest, Local Natives, or anything in that indie genre from the last few years or that classic 70s pop rock sound."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome, can't wait to hear these songs!"
