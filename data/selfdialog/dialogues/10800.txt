"__FASHION__ I'm making my baby's clothes instead of buying them."
"__FASHION__ That's an interesting idea. It seems like no one does that anymore."
"__FASHION__ I like having control over fabric and style."
"__FASHION__ Are you good at it? I've never seen you sew."
"__FASHION__ I sew pretty well. I learned years ago."
"__FASHION__ Maybe you could design something for me to wear to my wedding then."
"__FASHION__ I surely could. Let's start now."
"__FASHION__ OK. First of all I like white for a wedding dress."
"__FASHION__ Good choice. Any particular style?"
"__FASHION__ I like it to be tight at the top with a bell shaped skirt."
"__FASHION__ That sounds lovely."
"__FASHION__ And I'd like beading on the skirt."
"__FASHION__ Maybe pearls?"
"__FASHION__ Maybe."
"__FASHION__ Or crystals?"
"__FASHION__ I'm sure either would be fine."
"__FASHION__ Maybe you could have both."
"__FASHION__ That's what I'd like."
"__FASHION__ This is going to be a beautiful dress."
"__FASHION__ Thanks for helping with it."
