"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who for you is the most disappointing QB ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ever? Greatest rolls off the brain easy, but most disappointing? That one's tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have to say that Johnny Manziel by the Browns is mine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I nearly forgot he played for them. I'm going to say Jay Cutler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cutler took the bears to the playoffs, why him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say its more like the Bears took him to the playoffs..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lol, I can see that. But why Cutler?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just that he seems to struggle when the stakes are high, he throws Ints and fumbles, like he forgot how to play.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I like the Lions,but Stafford has some games like that too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, what about Mark Sanchez?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, he's a lot like Cutler, but with him it feels like overconfidence gets him more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, the team, whether its the Jets or the Eagles, get rolling and it is fumble or interception time for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I see him miss the Safety on deep throws all the time. Cutler is more inconsistent, but usually he misses a Blitz and goes down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a problem for Kaepernick too at times. He wants to rush or holds it too long trying to make a play happen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a big peeve of mine, so many times the plays that just wreck the game for the team are those 'make a play' ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, you need to be able to say when a play has failed and throw it away and regroup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To me, that's the mark of  a great vs. bad qb. Saying 'nope, not gonna happen today' when they need to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I also think the greats are good at shaking off the mistakes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt! Sanchez threw an INT or Cutler would and then the next set would be another turnover."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but with Manning, he'd look awful for 3 downs, and then when the ball is back in his hands it's like it never happened."
