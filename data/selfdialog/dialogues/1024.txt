"__MUSIC__ What is what? Start with the scales."
"__MUSIC__ Pentatonic and whole tone scales."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, now you have to explain that. Why did or How did Debussy invent these?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he didn't invent whole tone scales, Bach is the earliest one to have used them. They're scales where all the notes are separated by a whole step.;"
"__MUSIC__ So in C scale, the F gets a sharp and then all the notes after that also get a sharp?"
"__MUSIC__ WEll, you don't bee the B since A is sharped. So it goes C, D, E, F#, G#, A#, skip the B and to C."
"__MUSIC__ Ah ok. But why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the sense of direction you get is from the offsets in the scales."
"__MUSIC__ Um i don;t get a sense of direction in a song"
"__MUSIC__ of course you do. You feel the tension building up, about to reach the climax, etc."
"__MUSIC__ You're talking about sex."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, very mature. No I'm talking about the musical pregression that occurs quite naturally due to the offset of the notes in scale."
"__MUSIC__ ok fine, so whole tone scales have no offsets?"
"__MUSIC__ They don't have a very strong impression of a tonality"
"__MUSIC__ So it's atonal?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not atonal, whole tone scales doesn't have the sense of tonality.All the notes are same distance apart, so building the triads leads to augemented harmonies."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, wait. Hold up. Too much too fast. Start over."
"__MUSIC__ Whole tine scales do not have a very srtong sense of tonality or cente, because the notes are same distance apart."
"__MUSIC__ I got that much."
"__MUSIC__ So it creates this effect of an indistinct, directionless, almost, motion through the music."
