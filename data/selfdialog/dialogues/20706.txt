"__THRILLER__ What's the best Bruce Willis movie?"
"__THRILLER__ He has a number of good ones!"
"__THRILLER__ If you had to just pick one, which would it be?"
"__THRILLER__ I would either say, '12 Monkeys' or 'The Sixth Sense'"
"__THRILLER__ I haven't seen either of those."
"__THRILLER__ Then you are in for a treat, because I have both on DVD!"
"__THRILLER__ Which should I watch first?"
"__THRILLER__ The Sixth Sense, unless you are a big Brad Pitt fan."
"__THRILLER__ Why The Sixth Sense first?"
"__THRILLER__ Because moments after Bruce Willis drops his wedding ring, you will call me!"
