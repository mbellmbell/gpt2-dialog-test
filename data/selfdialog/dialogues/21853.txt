"__DISNEY__ I have A Whole New World stuck in my head."
"__DISNEY__ Is that the Disney song?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that's the one from Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ That's one of my all-time favorite Disney Movies."
"__DISNEY__ But which one is your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ Fern Gully I think."
"__DISNEY__ Fern Gully isn't actually a Disney film!"
"__DISNEY__ Really? I always thought it was!"
"__DISNEY__ Nope! My favorite is The Rescuers."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my God, the little mice in that movie are so cute!"
