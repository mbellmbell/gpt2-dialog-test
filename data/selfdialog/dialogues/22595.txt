"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Wall-E?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean that CGI movie Disney did with the blocky looking robot who loves old musicals?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, that's the movie! Have you seen it?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I haven't."
"__DISNEY__ But if you haven't seen it, how do you know so much about it?"
"__DISNEY__ I watched a few trailers for the movie. It looks interesting, especially that other robot -- the rounded white one that floats around."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, you must be talking about EVE. Yes, she's amazing as well!"
"__DISNEY__ So, you obviously liked it a lot, I'm assuming."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. You would never guess that robots could be so expressive and emotionally endearing as characters."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I definitely need to go see it now."
