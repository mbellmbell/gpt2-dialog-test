"__MUSIC__ Let's get into the great pop wars of our time, where you team Britney or Christina?"
"__MUSIC__ See, this was very tough for me.  I liked Britney's showmanship, but I think Christina was more talented."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but if you had to pick one who would it be?"
"__MUSIC__ Britney, I guess.  I was so sad when she went crazy."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like Christina never got the promotion she needed from her record company.  She could be a bigger star than she is now."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I definitely agree with this."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, were you team BSB or NSYNC?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, NSYNC hands down!  Justin Timberlake was going to be my husband back then."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you on this one, except he was going to be MY husband."
"__MUSIC__ He was so cute back then.  He's okayish now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  Getting older is not a good look on him.  What were your thoughts on Mandy Moore and Jessica Simpson?"
"__MUSIC__ I was team Jessica until Newlyweds came on and I found out how dumb she was."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but Mandy seems like she thinks she's better than everyone."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I get the vibe that she is fake."
"__MUSIC__ We'll call it a draw.  Did you like Limp Bizkit or Korn?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, to this day I still rock both on bad days!  They are my guilty pleasure, but I would have to go with Korn."
"__MUSIC__ See, I had a think for the LB guitarist so I have to go with them."
"__MUSIC__ Wes Borland?  OMG, that is hysterical.  He was so weird!"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, he was just artistic.  You just didn't understand him."
"__MUSIC__ HAHA, okay then.  We will agree to disagree!"
