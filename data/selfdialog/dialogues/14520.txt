"__HORROR__ House of Horror's Emporium.  How can I help you?"
"__HORROR__ HI, I was looking for the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Do you have it in?"
"__HORROR__ Ah, well, let me check.  That was when about...77, 76?"
"__HORROR__ 1974.  Long time ago.  Lot of gore for that era."
"__HORROR__ Oh, yeah, that was in the golden age of blood and body parts."
"__HORROR__ Well, I'd like to see it again if you guy got it in.  That or The Shining with Jack Nicholson."
"__HORROR__ Well, let me check here.  No, no looks like Texas Chainsaw is out right now.  Want me to check The Shining?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah, hopefully you have that.  I want something that's really gonna scare me again.  That movie always did that."
"__HORROR__ Here's Jonny.  Yep got it.  I'll put it behind the shelf for you."
"__HORROR__ Great. Hey another one of his I might want to see is Wolf.  You got it in?"
