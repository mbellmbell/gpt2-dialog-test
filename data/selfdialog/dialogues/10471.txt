"__RAP_HIPHOP__ When was the last time we got something from Kim?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Lil Kim? She just released a new mixtape."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ No kidding? What's it called?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Lil Kim Season, but she also released Hardcore 2016."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hardcore 2016? Does it sample her debut?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean, not really. It's kind of a tribute in name only."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Would you say they are worth checking out?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Honestly, no. The production on it is really rough."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But didn't she just hook up with Bad Boy again?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but only on a short term basis, I think."
