"__MUSIC__ Let's get dark about music."
"__MUSIC__ Bring it."
"__MUSIC__ Let's assume you are on your deathbed in a hospice and you can choose your playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Okay."
"__MUSIC__ What do you want to listen to as you die?"
"__MUSIC__ Oooh, good one. That's a heck of an ice-breaker."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I always ask this on blind dates."
"__MUSIC__ I'm having the time of my life. Let me think about it - what about yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I want something super slow and gorgeous."
"__MUSIC__ 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten?'"
"__MUSIC__ That's a great choice, but no. I think the Jurassic Park theme."
"__MUSIC__ I thought you said slow and gorgeous. That's loud and brassy."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard it slowed by 1000%? It's about an hour long."
"__MUSIC__ No, what's it like?"
"__MUSIC__ Slow and gorgeous, as I said. You can't really hear where they are in it, but you know what's happening at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yours?"
"__MUSIC__ The Oceanic six theme from Lost. It's unbeliveably gorgeous."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't seen that so I don't know it."
"__MUSIC__ It's got constant counterpoint. I warm up and go limp when I hear it. I think it'd be nice."
