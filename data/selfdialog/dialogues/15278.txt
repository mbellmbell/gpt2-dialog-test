"__HARRY_POTTER__ Who do you think your favorite professor would have been?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't know that's a hard one. Probably Hagrid so we could get into trouble."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Not me. I think McGonagall would have been my fave. She knew her stuff but knew how to have fun sometimes too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're right. She had lots on one liners especially towards the end of the book when she was pissed off with Umbridge."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ugh. Umbridge sucks so bad."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know I still feel so bad for Harry having to carve that crap into his hand."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He really put up with a lot from her. She was the worst."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right. She was worse than Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah Snape was just mental abuse."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I don't even blame Snape anymore for anything. Now that we saw the flashbacks."
