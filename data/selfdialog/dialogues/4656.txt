"__MUSIC__ I hate it when people denigrate any one particular genre of music, like it's worthless or something."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's necessarily bad."
"__MUSIC__ And just because you like metal or folk or rap or whatever doesn't mean that is the be-all-end-all only decent music on earth."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Musical elitism is incredibly annoying."
"__MUSIC__ Pop music in particular gets a bad rap."
"__MUSIC__ It's true. People forget how much of what can be considered essential now, was looked down upon as teeny-bopper pop at the time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like The Beatles. And let's not forget how many classic pop songs are still being made."
"__MUSIC__ It's true."
"__MUSIC__ I really feel like you can't really claim to be a music lover and then turn around and flat out dismiss an entire genre."
"__MUSIC__ Or several genres."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. The world needs pop and rap and rock and country and classical and whatever else you can think of in equal measure."
"__MUSIC__ Having them all around leads to them influencing each other, and possibly creating the next big thing."
"__MUSIC__ If we just listened to the same thing over and over it would get incredibly boring."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, that being said, I really can't bring myself to listen to death metal or anything like that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh no, me neither."
"__MUSIC__ I am not saying it's awful, or shouldn't exist, but it really just isn't for me."
"__MUSIC__ Right, of course. I feel the same way about really hardcore gangsta rap."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah me too. And really twangy country singers."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, right. Of course."
