"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I think I'm the only person who hasn't seen it yet!"
"__MOVIES__ What? Why haven't you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Just haven't gotten around to it yet. Did you think it was actually good?"
"__MOVIES__ I totally did. You know I don't even really like superhero movies, but this was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ In what way?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, both the leads (Gal Gadot and Chris Pine) were really engaging, and had great chemistry together."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. They're both pretty attractive as stars."
"__MOVIES__ But what was really fun for me was the way the female director shot this movie."
"__MOVIES__ Did it actually make a difference, you think?"
"__MOVIES__ For me it did. I liked how the camera didn't really seem to objectify Diana's character in the way most movies do."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, interesting. I didn't really think about how having a woman director might influence things."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, the fight scene across no-mans-land is AMAZING!"
"__MOVIES__ No-man's land?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, this particular story is kind of a creation story, and it's set during World War I."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa, I didn't know that. So, fighting Nazis?"
"__MOVIES__ World War I. Still Germans, but not Nazis."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, right. The previews I've seen look a little steampunk."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the London scenes definitely are. At any rate, you should definitely see it. It was amazing. I want to see it again."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you've convinced me."
