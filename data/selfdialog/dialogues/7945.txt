"__POP__ Do you like Taylor Swift?"
"__POP__ I'm not the biggest fan. She's a bit too pleasant sounding for my taste."
"__POP__ I could see that. She is really popular in younger audiences."
"__POP__ I respect the fact that she writes some of her own music, though."
"__POP__ Yeah, she also really plays the guitar well."
"__POP__ True. I do catch myself singing along to 'Bad Blood' sometimes."
"__POP__ It's hard not to. The chorus to that song is awesome."
"__POP__ I don't really know many of her other songs. They blur together for me."
"__POP__ I'm sure you've heard 'Shake It Off'. I've been listening to that a lot lately."
"__POP__ Oh yeah. That one was all over the radio."
