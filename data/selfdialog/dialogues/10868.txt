"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's almost time for football to start training camps again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know.  I have been looking forward to this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, last year was good, but I expect even better results this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now that the Cowboy's new quarterback, Dak Prescott, has a year of experience, he should be even better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You would think so, but do you think he can top last year's performance?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be tough, that's for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I was thinking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depends on how that offensive line will do this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They keep getting better and better every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, so maybe this year will be the year the whole team actually makes it past the 1st playoff game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just frustrating to have a good season, then not be able to win a playoff game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe it has to do with the coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Teams do prepare differently when it is a playoff game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And maybe Jason Garrett just doesn't know how to prepare the team when it comes to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's very possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have only won one playoff game since he has been the head coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, believe me, I know!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, lets just hope this is the year to take it all the way!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am so excited, I can't wait for them to start playing games!"
