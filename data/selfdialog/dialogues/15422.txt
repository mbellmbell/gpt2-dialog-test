"__HARRY_POTTER__ Heard you finally finished watching Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire. What did you think?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think the movies are starting to get a little too far removed from the books. What did you think?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah I thought so too, but the actors are all great. So what can we do?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ My point exactly! Emma Watson and Katie Leung were my favorites."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Seeing the visuals have really reinforced the book imagery for me. It's kind of hard to picture faces and places you've never been to before."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yep, especially the costumes. It's also hard to imagine the magical creatures J.K. Rowling dreamed up."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also liked the intensity of Voldemort coming back to life. It's harder to get scared reading a book."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The comedy was funnier too. Ron's dress robes were especially hilarious."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So when you gonna watch number Order of The Phoenix? Anytime soon?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I was thinking of buying all eight movies on Blu-ray and maybe marathon it this weekend. Come over if you want, it's supposed to make more sense watching them all back-to-back-to-back."
