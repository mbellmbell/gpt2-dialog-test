"__FASHION__ Did you see the pictures from fashion week of the Balenciaga catwalk?"
"__FASHION__ Some of them, why?"
"__FASHION__ Those jackets with the huge 1980s shoulder pads are too much."
"__FASHION__ I know! Sometimes I wonder who wears some of the fashion from the runway."
"__FASHION__ The jackets were so boxy and the shoulder pads were huge."
"__FASHION__ There were a lot of sheer pieces during spring fashion week too."
"__FASHION__ I saw a pair of sheer trousers that looked like clear plastic trash bags."
"__FASHION__ I know, right?"
"__FASHION__ I did like the sheer lace dresses that Dolce and Gabanna were showing."
"__FASHION__ I did too but I didn't like the lace ruffle at the bottom."
"__FASHION__ I thought the ruffle at the bottom was actually kind of cute."
"__FASHION__ Speaking of sheer and showing it off, there were a ton of bralettes shown."
"__FASHION__ The one that Kendall Jenner wore was kind of cute. The black scrappy one that went around her neck and crisscrossed in the front."
"__FASHION__ That was cute. It was just really basic. There were some beautiful ones that weren't as basic. There were florals and even some velvet bralettes."
"__FASHION__ I must have missed those. I'm not sure about bralettes as a fashion piece for wearing in public anyway."
"__FASHION__ I think they can be really pretty with high waisted pants or skirts."
"__FASHION__ I actually really like that look. That way a smaller portion of the stomach shows."
"__FASHION__ Exactly."
"__FASHION__ Maybe I will look for a bralette/high waisted skirt combo next time I'm shopping."
"__FASHION__ Yes, you should. See if anyone makes that in a floral."
