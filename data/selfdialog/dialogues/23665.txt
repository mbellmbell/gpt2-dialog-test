"__DISNEY__ Hey did you hear about the new Incredibles movie coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I've been waiting for this movie since I was a kid!"
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if it will have all the same villains like Syndrome and the Underminer!"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know but I just hope they bring Edna back!"
"__DISNEY__ No matter what I'm going to be in the theater the day it comes out!"
"__DISNEY__ Same here, I've been waiting since 2004!"
"__DISNEY__ Pixar has really mastered the whole animated movie scene huh?"
"__DISNEY__ Of course! They keep making hit after hit."
"__DISNEY__ There certainly is no slowing them down."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah especially if they keep releasing continuations of old movies!"
