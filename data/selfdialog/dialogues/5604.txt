"__STAR_WARS__ One thing that made fans angry about the prequels was the clone armor."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was the problem with it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ In all the other movies, they have physical costumes."
"__STAR_WARS__ Alright, go on."
"__STAR_WARS__ But in the prequels, it's all entirely CGI.  No armor was built as it wasn't needed."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've never noticed before to be honest with you."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's completely true.  They didn't see the need since they weren't being staffed by actors"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first prequels relied a bit too heavy on special effects."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would agree.  They were never quite to my liking."
"__STAR_WARS__ Thankfully, it improved later on as fan criticism took its toll on the filmmakers."
