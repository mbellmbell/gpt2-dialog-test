"__MOVIES__ Have you seen 'Get Out'?"
"__MOVIES__ Is it that horror movie that was recently released? No, not yet."
"__MOVIES__ It's a masterpiece. You should really see it!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll check it out, then. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I can't spoil the plot too much, but I can say it's more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's reassuring to hear."
"__MOVIES__ And it has a underlying message about racial tensions in the US. It has many well-though analogies and metaphors."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great! Do you have other recommendations?"
"__MOVIES__ Well if you like thrillers, I'd also recommend the recent movie, 'Split.'"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I've seen that! The one about the guy with dissociative identity disorder, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one. I went in with low expectations because it was directed by Shyamalan."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. But it turned out to be much better than anyone expected."
"__MOVIES__ I really like how they showed the psychiatrist's passion about dissociative identity disorder."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that made the film much richer. It also made me want to learn more about this disorder."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Shyamalan has redeemed himself as a director, now?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Lots of people were really disappointed with what he did with 'Avatar: The Last Airbender.'"
"__MOVIES__ That movie was quite a disappointment, especially for all the fans of the TV show."
"__MOVIES__ Well, at least he's going in the right direction now."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know if he's directing any films now?"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard he's directing a film called 'Glass,' that's being released in 2019."
