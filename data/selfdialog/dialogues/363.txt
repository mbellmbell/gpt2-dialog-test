"__MUSIC__ What do you think of the new Katy Perry album?"
"__MUSIC__ Witness? It's okay."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can't tell what I think about it one way or another."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't like the lead single too much when it first came out, but it grew on me. And the other 2 are pretty good as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I like them, but something feels a bit odd about the whole thing."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. It almost feels like she's trying a little bit too hard."
"__MUSIC__ Well she certainly is trying. I don't think there's a single TV show left that she hasn't been on to try and promote it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I saw her on a couple."
"__MUSIC__ I even saw her on Gordon Ramsay's The F Word the other day. It was a cute bit, but seemed a little bit of an odd place to go."
"__MUSIC__ It does kind of make me root for her to succeed a little bit more though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I can see that."
"__MUSIC__ After getting out there to promote it so heavily, it would be a shame if it just totally bombed."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if it does, it won't be for like of trying."
"__MUSIC__ At least not as far as promotion goes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, perhaps if they had tried to make the album a bit better."
"__MUSIC__ She certainly has it in her. The last couple were pretty consistently good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Maybe producers don't want to work with her as much now that she's older?"
"__MUSIC__ It could be."
"__MUSIC__ That would suck."
"__MUSIC__ It certainly would."
