"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Eh, okay I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Just okay?"
"__MOVIES__ Just okay.  It wasn't bad by any means, but I felt they left a lot of meat on the bone."
"__MOVIES__ Explain what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ Sure.  It seems that they rushed the script out."
"__MOVIES__ You mean that they didn't try very hard to make a good picture?"
"__MOVIES__ I think there were different plots they could have come up with to make it more meaningful."
"__MOVIES__ Kurt Russell's character was going to end a whole bunch of worlds."
"__MOVIES__ Right, but the premise was kind of ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Too much like the first one.  Again, it just felt rushed."
"__MOVIES__ I do get that angle a bit.  At times, I felt like I was watching the first one."
"__MOVIES__ And there's nothing wrong with using good elements of the first, but you have to be careful."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of Baby Groot?"
"__MOVIES__ Indifferent.  I mean, it was an interesting take, hated how they made him stupid."
"__MOVIES__ You mean the scene near the end to blow everything up?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  They completely butchered the entire ending."
"__MOVIES__ Those are all valid points.  Wonder what they'll do in the next one."
"__MOVIES__ They're making another?  Goodness me, they won't stop."
