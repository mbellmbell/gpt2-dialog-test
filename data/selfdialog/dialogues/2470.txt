"__MUSIC__ Hey, I'm looking to go to Coachella. Do you want to join?"
"__MUSIC__ I would most definitively not like to join."
"__MUSIC__ What... why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, how many are going?"
"__MUSIC__ I have five so far."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that's too many people in one van for a long trip to Nowhere, California."
"__MUSIC__ Okay... but it'll be fun."
"__MUSIC__ It's full of hipsters and obnoxious celebrities."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it will cost a lot, but you've never gone to a music festival before."
"__MUSIC__ So it's a rite of passage?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that sounds about right. Plus Lady Gaga will be there, and you love her."
"__MUSIC__ I do love her, but I'd rather watch her in a small venue."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been to a festival?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, to hear Meatloaf."
"__MUSIC__ How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he sung great, but I hated the venue."
"__MUSIC__ You just hate everything, don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much. You know I don't like crowds, crowded areas, and hipsters."
"__MUSIC__ Sorry for inviting you."
"__MUSIC__ It's okay. I forgive you."
