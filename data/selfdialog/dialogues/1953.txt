"__MUSIC__ Katy Perry really has been a chameleon, hasn't she?"
"__MUSIC__ I know she's done a few things.    What are you thinking about?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, currently she has a completely new look with her new album."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I heard Witness, and liked it more than some of her other stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Then before that was the Roar single."
"__MUSIC__ Good song, loved the outfit in that video and on Graham Norton."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like that more than the whipped cream video for California Gurls?"
"__MUSIC__ I had forgotten about that.      Yes, and wasn't there a rapper in that video too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, Snoop Dogg was at the beginning."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't she also tie some sort of chart record?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe so.       I think she had five number one singles from her most popular album."
"__MUSIC__ Which album was that?"
"__MUSIC__ The Teenage Dream album"
"__MUSIC__ That's the one.     Anyone do that it the past?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe Michael Jackson with Bad."
"__MUSIC__ One thing about her though, I think her second album made her popular."
"__MUSIC__ Really?    I don't think One of the Boys was as popular as some of her others."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't, but it had that song I Kissed a Girl"
"__MUSIC__ Understood!    Yes, the sexiness launched that song."
"__MUSIC__ True, and even a marriage to Russell Brand could not stop that train!"
