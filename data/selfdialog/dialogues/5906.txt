"__STAR_WARS__ Who do you think would win in a fight between Darth Maul and Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh Maul all the way.  He's a far better swordsman than Vader ever was."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way, Vader would have destroyed Maul with his superior knowledge of the force.  Look at the closing scene of Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maul had plenty understanding of the force.  He was extremely skilled and more aggressive."
"__STAR_WARS__ Vader destroyed half the Jedi on his own.  He was the strongest bad in the Star Wars saga."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way, look at the way Darth Maul nearly defeated both Qui Gon and Obi Wan at the same time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah when Obi Wan was a beginner.  Old Obi Wan would have stomped him in seconds."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know about that.  His double sides light saber was something else."
"__STAR_WARS__ But I do agree, they were both absolutely awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I wish they would have kept Maul for at least one more movie."
