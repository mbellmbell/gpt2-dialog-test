"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think are some up and coming teams this year in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Up and coming teams. Tampa Bay and Tennessee come to mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see those two teams. Tampa was in the playoff hunt last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And they are playing in the NFC South. Seems like a different team wins that division every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems that way because it's pretty much true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tampa could win that division this year. They have a lot of talent on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Jameis Winston and Mike Evans will continue to put up big numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see them as a 10-6 or 11-5 team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 11 and 5 might be stretching it. But yes, I definitely could see 10 and 6."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tennessee also may be up and coming. They are playing in the AFC South."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The AFC South is definitely the weakest division in football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ By a mile. I believe Mariotta will be back in the lineup to start the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 9 and 7 might win that division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 9 and 7 could. Tennessee could easily go 9 and 7."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Houston is kind of fading out. They have another quarterback this year, don't they."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. They change quarterbacks like I change socks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Indianapolis is always in the hunt in the AFC South."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Luck has ran into a lot of bad luck recently. Not sure what's wrong with him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He might not be as good as advertised. He's a good quarterback but not elite."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not from his past few seasons he's not. He's still young and can turn it around."
