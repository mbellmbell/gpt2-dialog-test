"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Radiohead?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course, they're one of the most defining bands of this century, I think. I don't think they've put out anything good since In Rainbows, though."
"__MUSIC__ Uh, are you serious? A Moon Shaped Pool was fantastic -- it came out last year -- and Amnesiac is criminally underrated."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sorry, that's just not true. Love all their other stuff, though."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't see how you can be a fan of them, but not like their recent records."
"__MUSIC__ Let me live! Honestly, I just don't think artists can be consistent for that long. I don't know anyone who's done that."
"__MUSIC__ Have you never listened to David Bowie? Bob Dylan?"
"__MUSIC__ There's no way you can say Bob Dylan has the same relevancy now as fifty years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, but he's put out some good stuff. All I'm saying is, there have been plenty of artists that have been consistently good for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you have a point about David Bowie. Although some of his 90s stuff was questionable."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, but Blackstar definitely made up for that. You know, Slowdive is another band that has had a successful comeback recently."
"__MUSIC__ Have they? I didn't know they put out anything new recently."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they have a new self-titled album that's pretty good. That's hard to do, you know."
"__MUSIC__ Eh, I might listen to it. I prefer to listen to new artists, though. I guess that's all I'm trying to say."
"__MUSIC__ Good music is good music. Who cares if it's a debut. Haven't heard any good debuts anyway."
"__MUSIC__ You're not going to convince me about this! I'm just going to go listen to OK Computer for the 100th time."
"__MUSIC__ Not even their best album, but okay."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'm not even going to have that argument with you."
"__MUSIC__ Have you not heard Kid A?"
"__MUSIC__ Just stop!"
