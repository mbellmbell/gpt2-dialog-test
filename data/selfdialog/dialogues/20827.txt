"__THRILLER__ I have this really old thriller movie on my mind lately and I can't remember what it's called."
"__THRILLER__ Do you remember what it was about?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I remember there was this young girl and there was something about phone calls..."
"__THRILLER__ It wasn't When a Stranger Calls, was it?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I remember that one about the babysitter, but -- Oh, it was that she was making prank phone calls!"
"__THRILLER__ Okay..."
"__THRILLER__ But something went wrong. Somehow she found out that one of the people she called had really done something bad."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, that sounds like I Saw What You Did!"
"__THRILLER__ That's it! I kept thinking it was something like, 'I Know Who You Are' but when I searched online nothing came up."
"__THRILLER__ That's because that's part of the line she used in the prank calls. I remember watching this movie growing up, how she'd say 'I saw what you did, and I know who you are'."
