"__BEATLES__ Yeah, of course.  Who doesn't?"
"__BEATLES__ Do you prefer their earlier stuff or later?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know.  It depends on my mood."
"__BEATLES__ I understand.  Their later stuff is much deeper."
"__BEATLES__ Exactly.  If I'm in a more cheerful mood, the earlier stuff."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, that makes sense.  What's your favorite earlier stuff?"
"__BEATLES__ I still like 'All My Loving' I think."
