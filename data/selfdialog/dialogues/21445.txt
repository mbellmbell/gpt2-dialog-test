"__DISNEY__ Have you seen that one movie Disney made called BFG?"
"__DISNEY__ It's about that Giant that is actually smaller than the other giants and a good one right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yup that's the one. I liked it a lot but what did you think?"
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was pretty good. It had some funny moments."
"__DISNEY__ The way the giant spoke was funny and the little girl was adorable with her personality."
"__DISNEY__ I was a little surprised about the green drink though."
"__DISNEY__ True, the having them fart in the Queen of England's presence was a bit much."
"__DISNEY__ It was pretty funny though but I feel like slightly tacky."
"__DISNEY__ The best part was the ending though."
"__DISNEY__ I loved how they forced the evil giants to be on a rock island with nothing but the horrible vegetable to eat."
