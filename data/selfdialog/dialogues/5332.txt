"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like Star Wars or Star Trek?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm definitely more of a Star Wars guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Why do you like it so much. I love the tech, and the futuristic points in Star Trek."
"__STAR_WARS__ They are really different shows. I like both, but the fantasy in Star Wars gets me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I see that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Especially since I've really grown with the characters through the Universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Star Wars characters are really unique, and all have interesting, wacky storylines."
"__STAR_WARS__ Star trek has more tragedy, more of an alien, sci-fi component to it."
"__STAR_WARS__ But aren't all the Star Wars characters weird enough to be aliens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Aren't we all aliens?"
