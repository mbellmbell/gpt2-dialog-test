"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch last years Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I did. What a rollercoaster of game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably the craziest Superbowl I have ever watched in my entire life."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah def. a top 3 Superbowl of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still can't wrap my mind around how bad the Falcons choked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Blew a 23-3 lead after halftime, yeah I would say they choked pretty bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I despise the Patroits but you have to give respect were respect is due."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Couldn't have said it better myself. I hate Tom Brady with a passion but that man is very talented."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady's not even that good of a quarterback, it's Bill Belichick who deserves most the credit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Brady is decent but he's not as good as like Drew Brees when it comes to executing passes. But yeah Belichick is a mad man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Brees has had like 6 5,000 yard seasons, you can't compare the two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree but it was oddly satisfying seeing the Falcons crumble and burn live on television."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was about to turn off the game at halftime, I'm glad I didn't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha c'mon man it's still the Superbowl. I was going to finish watching it regardless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you see the end when the entire stadium started to boo Roger Goodell?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was probably the highlight of the entire Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate that guy with a burning passion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here and I think every other NFL fan does too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know what NFL stands for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 'No Fun League'"
