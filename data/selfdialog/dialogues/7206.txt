"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like Lady Gaga?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ While I like some of her music, she has always kind of annoyed me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah.  I know what you mean.  It is like she tries way to hard."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Exactly!  I do have to admit that she does have an incredible voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know.  I was shocked when she performed Julie Andrews classics."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I know.  I was blown away."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I also like her duet with Tony Bennett."
"__LADY_GAGA__ She did do a good job with that.  Her other music is alright too.  I really like that Poker Face song when I am working out."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Agreed.  Her music is good to workout too."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yep.  Like you said before, her music is good enough but her persona and antics are her drawback.  I guess it is what she had to do to get noticed."
