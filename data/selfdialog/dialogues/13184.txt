"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard they grabbed him in the first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't understand how hey got picked before Geno."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you. Geno would kill Manuel on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you image what was going through Geno's head when EJ held that jersey up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cutler and Romo both should be on a stranded island somewhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know they pumped Geno up like he would get first round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they all assumed New England would grab them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they probably didn't want to waste a pick they thought they wouldn't get."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He did have some impressive plays. None of them got Flacco to the finals."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He started in 2011."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For some reason he remind me of Vick, classic Vick."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They could have had a killer starting line up off the drafts alone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How much longer does Flacco have on his contract?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now there is a biasis opinion."
