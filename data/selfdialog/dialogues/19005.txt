"__MOVIES__ So did you see the new Wonder Woman movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Dude, heck yeah! It was so so good!"
"__MOVIES__ I know, I was so glad that DC finally got a good movie!"
"__MOVIES__ After Batman vs. Superman I thought that franchise was over, to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they'd just gotten way too dark and gritty. I like that for Batman, but not everyone!"
"__MOVIES__ And Wonder Woman's just unapologetically good, I really appreciated that."
"__MOVIES__ I think she and Steve Rogers would get along well."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the same thing! It's too bad they're in different universes."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that, and you can only have so many Steves dying in planes in a world war in one franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, yeah, I thought about that, it's funny how that worked out."
"__MOVIES__ What was your favourite scene?"
"__MOVIES__ Well first, the humor was fantastic--like when Diana walked in on Steve?"
"__MOVIES__ And she said 'what is that' and he thought she meant his... uh, member?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I about died laughing!"
"__MOVIES__ And all of her interactions with the secretary were pretty spot on too."
"__MOVIES__ I agree."
"__MOVIES__ For dramatic scenes, though, I thought that the No Man's Land scene was fantastic."
"__MOVIES__ I loved how she was just like, no, I came here to help people."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! A very Steve Rogers thing if I do say so myself."
"__MOVIES__ Too true, too true."
