"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd have to say 'A New Hope'. It's the first that was produced by George Lucas."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you like it so much?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not for the acting, except for Sir Alec Guinness;  but for the whole romance of it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Romance?! You mean between Luke and Leia?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, no, I mean - look at it! It's set on desert planet orbiting two suns, there's atmosphere there!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What, like air?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I mean the kind of feeling you get when you watch 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Desert romance."
"__STAR_WARS__ I didn't get that. Can you give me an example?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. The best moment is the sunset on Tatooine, as Luke watches the twin suns go down the shadows deepen in the desert, the music swells, and you feel like you're right there on Tatooine with him."
