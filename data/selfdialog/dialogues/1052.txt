"__MUSIC__ One of the theaters near me is doing The Last Five Years."
"__MUSIC__ Ooh, I saw that show once!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember. I wanted to ask you if it was any good."
"__MUSIC__ It was excellent, as long as it's your thing."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well how into Broadway music are you?"
"__MUSIC__ It really depends on the style. I don't want to go see The Music Man or anything."
"__MUSIC__ Oh this isn't that style at all, definitely contemporary."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like it might be more up my street. What are the songs like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there are only two people in the show, a man and a woman."
"__MUSIC__ Ok. It's not repetitive though is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all! They both go through a lot during the show and the songs follow them through it."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well here's an example. At the beginning Cathy's opening song is ridiculously sad, slow, and harsh."
"__MUSIC__ You're really selling this... not."
"__MUSIC__ Bear with me. She's going backwards though time here so as the show goes on she gets happier and a Lot funnier."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, so there's a lot of range emotionally?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. She starts off crying and then one of her last songs is this hilarious take on auditioning."
"__MUSIC__ And the guy in the show's music does the same sort of thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, except in the other direction so there's balance, you see?"
