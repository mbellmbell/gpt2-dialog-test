"__MUSIC__ One time I was with this guy, riding back home in his truck."
"__MUSIC__ Uh-uh."
"__MUSIC__ And this song came on."
"__MUSIC__ What was it?"
"__MUSIC__ A song that was like our life at that moment. It was so awkward."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? What was it?"
"__MUSIC__ She Fuckin' Hates Me!"
"__MUSIC__ By Puddle of Mud?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, that's funny."
"__MUSIC__ Dude. I was trying so hard not to burst into laughter when that song came on. It was like our theme song."
"__MUSIC__ OMG! That's hilarious!"
"__MUSIC__ I know! She fuckin hates me! I tried so hard and she tore my feelings like I had none, ripped them away!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think he knew that was y'all's song?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think he had a clue. That's what was so funny."
"__MUSIC__ Oh gosh."
"__MUSIC__ I was just thinking to myself, 'Hahahahahaha that's so you! That's so me! Hahahahaha'"
"__MUSIC__ Poor guy."
"__MUSIC__ And he's just singing along like oblivious."
"__MUSIC__ I repeat, poor guy."
