"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you ready for the upcoming NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am, but honestly I like college football better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way. NFL is so much better than college ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I disagree. College football has the rivalries. The color. The music. So much more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe so, but you have to admit the quality of NFL is so much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed in big games. But watching a bad NFL team play a strong NFL team can be pretty boring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but the same can be said for college football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will agree with that. But I love to watch my college's team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But don't you feel the same towards your pro team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are the Browns so not really. Just joking. I agree but not quite as much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will win this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Patriots are always good. Same with Seatlle, Denver, Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. To me the NFL season really gets going around Thanksgiving."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Especially with cold weather, snow, etc."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and what is it with warm weather teams and domes. That and to much artifical turf."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like watching the snow games and rainy games. Much better than 70 degrees inside."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who wins it this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I will go out on a limb and pick the Patriots"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty big limb you are going out on. I am picking Green Bay."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Safe pick. Well should be fun to watch. See ya."
