"__MOVIES__ I saw the new Wonder Woman movie last night."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah?  What did you think."
"__MOVIES__ Surprisingly good.  Great character story I thought."
"__MOVIES__ It helped erase some of the stink from Batman vs. Superman."
"__MOVIES__ Well, she didn't need to be in that movie anyway."
"__MOVIES__ They were trying to introduce her character into the DC universe."
"__MOVIES__ I guess, but I wonder if they could have accomplished the same thing by just placing her directly in Justice League."
"__MOVIES__ Probably so."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, with the new movie, I liked the direction quite a bit."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that it was done quite compellingly."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, it was actually a female direction."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty cool.  You don't see many in the director's chair these days."
"__MOVIES__ The set pieces were done excellently.  Lots of emotion throughout the film."
"__MOVIES__ I heard one criticism though."
"__MOVIES__ What's that?"
"__MOVIES__ That the end battle was way too much CGI."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with that to a point.  It got a bit heavy-handed."
"__MOVIES__ But overall, it sounds like you enjoyed the experience."
"__MOVIES__ Most definitely.  Highly recommend."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to catch a showing this weekend."
