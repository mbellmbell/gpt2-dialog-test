"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard any music by The Decemberists?"
"__MUSIC__ No.  At least I don't think so."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, well, they are my favorite band!"
"__MUSIC__ What's their music like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're kind of a folk-influenced indie rock band."
"__MUSIC__ A little like Fleet Foxes or Iron & Wine then?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, sort of like that.  I'd be happy to loan you one of their albums."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, that'd be great.  So, is it your favorite album then?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think it's better to start with a different one of their albums than my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Because my favorite album of theirs- 'The Hazards of Love'- is a rock opera."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, well, I guess a rock opera isn't a very standard entry point into a band's catalogue."
"__MUSIC__ If I buy a Decemberists album for someone I like, I've usually picked 'The Crane Wife' since I feel like it's pretty solid and contains songs that show a pretty wide swath of what types of music they like to make.  ...But..."
"__MUSIC__ But what?  You're going to loan me a different album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the last time I gave 'The Crane Wife' to a friend, he told me he didn't get it...  So, I've been thinking about whether 'Castaways and Cutouts' might be a better entry point for someone new."
"__MUSIC__ I see.  Well, I'm willing to listen to whichever album you want to give me."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I should ask how you feel about really long songs or song sequences?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't have anything against them."
"__MUSIC__ Of course, The Decemberists have some short and average-length songs, but they also have some really long songs or songs that go together in sets."
"__MUSIC__ Well, being open to writings songs of different lengths probably opens things up for them creatively.  I'm happy to check them out."
