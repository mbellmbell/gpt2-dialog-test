"__HARRY_POTTER__ I had a Harry Potter movie marathon the other day."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Aren't those movies amazing?!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes! things you don't even realize were important are revealed to big deals later."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yes, like the whole time you don't even realize that Dumbledore has the elder wand ( A Deathly Hollow)"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Exactly, it's like everything connects in the end."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right, look at how Sirius was so important to Harry and trying to stop Voldemort from rising when the whole time his own brother had actually started his own mission to stop him long ago."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just wish they would've showed more of Voldemort's background, like the things that happened with his family history ."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, seeing how his mother tricked the muggle Tom Riddle into loving her with a love potion and resulting into Tom Marvel Riddle ( Voldemort ) being born and implied that since he was conceived under a love spell he can't love would've been pretty informative."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But the best part of the movies is Snape-Alan Rickman."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Absolutely, he was exactly how you could imaging Snape. He was perfect, and that scene of him dying in the boathouse makes me cry every single time."
