"__MOVIES__ I'm really excited for the Death Note movie!"
"__MOVIES__ The one that's coming to Netflix, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one! They haven't shown much but I think it looks great."
"__MOVIES__ Good for you, but I'd be cautious."
"__MOVIES__ What's wrong with being excited?"
"__MOVIES__ Look at other anime adaptions. Like Avatar for example was terrible."
"__MOVIES__ That was based on a cartoon actually."
"__MOVIES__ Fine then, take Dragon Ball Evolution. That was awful."
"__MOVIES__ I actually don't think it was that bad. It's better if you view it as a martial arts comedy than an anime film."
"__MOVIES__ But you admit as an adaption it's no good?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, it's not a great adaption, but it did pair up Justin Chatwin and Emmy Rossum for the first time. The two later went on to work on Shameless together, so I give the film credit for that."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, so the casting director realized they had good chemistry, big deal."
"__MOVIES__ See? If nothing else, there's a good chance the Death Note film cast will have good chemistry."
"__MOVIES__ Good chemistry will mean nothing if the adaption is poor."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I actually hope the movie will go in its own unique direction."
"__MOVIES__ Huh? What's the point in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the story has been adapted about five or six times already. I think it's time for something new."
"__MOVIES__ Ghost in the Shell tried to do something different, and people hated it."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of people actually liked it. I think just came out at a bad time."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe. I just hope for your sake that the Death Note movie is good."
