"__MUSIC__ What do you think is the music for gen X?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you know gen X covers a lot of territory. I would easily say 1965 to about 1975."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. I remember listening to Micheal Jackson, Blondie, Madonna, Men at Work."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember all of them too. I didn't listen to them but I remember them being popular."
"__MUSIC__ What about Air Supply, Hall and Oats, Chicago, Journey?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, all those sappy love ballads. We also had Queen and Asia."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, all that music is from when we were growing up. The music that I think defines our generation since I'm in the middle is the late 80's to early mid 90's."
"__MUSIC__ You mean alternative rock and the grunge movement. Yeah, I totally get that. I didn't listen to a lot of radio. I got music from friends and we passed it around."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, yes the iconic mixed tape!"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, some how it seems cooler than a CD though it definitely could get chewed up in the player."
"__MUSIC__ I had a few of those myself. I was into Nirvana, Pearl Jam, early REM. I didn't really like their newer material."
"__MUSIC__ We are on the same wave. I didn't listen to a lot of pop."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither. I wouldn't say never but a song would creep in here and there. I did have a 70's throw back at that time and I was listening to more of that than the norm."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. We were little kids then. The music was so different."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, some of it has to do with the vocals. They just had good voices and songs were good."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm having a hard time finding things these days even with apps like Pandora."
"__MUSIC__ It doesn't seem to make it easier. I usually find stuff I hear on shows and then go look for it of Shazam it."
"__MUSIC__ I do that too. I'm usually a year behind everyone else these days."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I will probably have to have a retro music weekend."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, you've given me the itch. Gen X music is turning out to be a classic."
