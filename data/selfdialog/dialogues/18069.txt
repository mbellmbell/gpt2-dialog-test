"__MOVIES__ I kind of feel bad for Johnny Depp."
"__MOVIES__ Huh, why?"
"__MOVIES__ Because his movies haven't been doing so well lately."
"__MOVIES__ What, the new Pirates movie? So what, it's just one film."
"__MOVIES__ You know, that movie was supposed to come out in 2015, I think. It kept getting delayed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I heard about that. Production seemed pretty troubled."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't help, but it's not just that. His other movies have all seemed to do bad, too."
"__MOVIES__ I can't think of any he's been in recently."
"__MOVIES__ Besides the new Pirates movie, there was that Alice in Wonderland sequel. Huge bomb."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I forgot that even existed!"
"__MOVIES__ There was also The Lone Ranger. Another huge bomb, even though it actually is a pretty good movie if I do say so."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you liked it? Maybe I'll check it out sometime."
"__MOVIES__ Goodness were the critics ever to hard on that. It is a real joy."
"__MOVIES__ That's high praise. I'll have to look into it."
"__MOVIES__ Funny though, those are all Disney films. I wonder when Disney will cut Depp loose."
"__MOVIES__ So he made a few bad movies. He'll bounce back."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but even before this there was Transcendence and Dark Shadows. Not to mention that controversy regarding his personal life."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you're saying. I'm still not convinced Disney will abandon him."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, it'll probably come down to how well Pirates 5 does overseas."
"__MOVIES__ Hehe. Yep, the foreign box office saves a lot of careers."
