"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking of watching a movie today."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't been to one of those in ages.  Anything look good?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, man.  There seems to be an awful lot of reboots here."
"__MOVIES__ Reboot?  What are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ Remake.  Do-over.  Reimagining."
"__MOVIES__ You mean a sequel?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Now that's something I could go for."
"__MOVIES__ What are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm talking about when some new young, up-and-coming director takes some old movie and makes it now-a-days."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I still don't know what you mean.  I hear it can take time to make some movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's not what I mean.  You remember Godzilla?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. That thing was a trip.  Squashing and destroying that poor Japanese town."
"__MOVIES__ Well they've already remade the first one twice."
"__MOVIES__ Two more movies!  Are they out now?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  But I'm sure both of them are playing on pay-per-view now.  They are basically the same move done at different times."
"__MOVIES__ So if I watch the first one, it's gonna look exactly like that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Maybe with a few modern elements and references."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't they do that with a bunch of movies already?"
"__MOVIES__ And television shows, toys, and games.  Most pop culture fads we both grew up with."
"__MOVIES__ No, thanks. You can go see your reboot. I think I'm just going to stay here and crash for the rest of the day."
