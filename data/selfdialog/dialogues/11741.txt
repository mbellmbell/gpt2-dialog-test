"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude, what happened to the Panthers last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, but man, they were bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were so feared in 2015."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they looked like Super Bowl champs for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, Denver ended that train of thought."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Newton is a bit overrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had a down year for sure, but he was the MVP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Was is the key word.  Not anymore and not even the best QB in the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't use him very well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should have him running the ball ten times a game.  You can't stop him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's a load to bring down.  I think they are worried about injury though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get that, but play to your strengths."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you can't utilize your strengths with a broken leg."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of which, didn't that happen to their linebacker?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean Luke Kuechly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's who I'm thinking of."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he got knocked because of concussions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he had both or something."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a tough year for him.  When healthy, he's a top 5 defensive player for sure."
