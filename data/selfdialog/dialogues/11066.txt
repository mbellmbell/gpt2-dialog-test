"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you an Eagles fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am. They're my favorite team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's awesome. What did you think of their draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought it was okay. I thought some picks were weak."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I felt they kind of wasted their 14th overall pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and that was the biggest deciding factor of their draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Derek Barnett is a good player but I don't feel it was the best choice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree there. They could have picked a player that would make a bigger difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they were probably just looking at the fact that he has a knack for getting to opposing quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does get a lot of sacks. That's a bit too situational to justify that pick, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally agree. I thought Sidney Jones was a good pick, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. He's probably the number one cornerback right now as far as I'm concerned."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I almost couldn't believe they landed him as a second round pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the only reason they did was because of his achilles injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I suppose that does make it a risky pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We've seen players come back from injuries like that before, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if he returns at one-hundred percent then they lucked out with that pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but that's what makes it a risk. He may not return at full health."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Injuries like that have a tendency to get in your head."
