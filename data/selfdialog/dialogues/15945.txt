"__ROCK__ See you Nickelback and Corey Taylor are fighting?"
"__ROCK__ Excuse me you're going to have to wait two seconds while I stop laughing."
"__ROCK__ Your reaction is the same as mine, what a ridiculous feud."
"__ROCK__ What's the fight about?"
"__ROCK__ Nickelback made some statement about writing a hit and Corey Taylor responded by calling Chad Kroeger names."
"__ROCK__ Like, schoolyard names?"
"__ROCK__ Yes he mentioned something about his face being ugly."
"__ROCK__ This is the best news I have ever heard."
"__ROCK__ I knew you'd enjoy it, two bands we hate going at it, what's not to love?"
"__ROCK__ Maybe they'll reconcile by writing an album together that will end the world."
