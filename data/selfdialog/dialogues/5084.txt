"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you see Fast and Furious 8, the Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes I did, and it was great.  Amazing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was good how Jason Statham got to be a good guy this time!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes it was, and he named his baby after Brian, the Paul Walker character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, that was a nice touch."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I could tell he was going to do it when his ex-girlfriend told him she only named his middle name so Dom could give the first name."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think I had an inkling too."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Then at the end they were having the barbecue and I knew what he was going to say...'Brian!'"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Haha, yeah that was funny."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ He always brings that 'family' thing into everything, that's what makes it a big hit in addition to all that action!"
