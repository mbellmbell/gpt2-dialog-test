"__MOVIES__ Are there any good movies out in theaters right now??"
"__MOVIES__ I recently just say Guardians of the Galaxy 2! It was so good."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to go see that. I recently saw the new Pirates of the Caribbean."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it??"
"__MOVIES__ I wasn't a huge fan of this one, this is probably the last of the series."
"__MOVIES__ It wouldn't surprise me either. Have you been to the Alamo Drafthouse??"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, I've heard great things about it though."
"__MOVIES__ It's so awesome, you can order dinner and drinks as you watch the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds amazing! What a great idea."
"__MOVIES__ It's a great way to enjoy the movies, a little bit pricier though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is dinner, drinks, and a movie all in one."
"__MOVIES__ You're so right. Did you see they added Moana to Netflix??"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I haven't had time to re-watch it yet."
"__MOVIES__ I've already played it twice since it's been added!!"
"__MOVIES__ You're do love your animations, and it's a great one."
"__MOVIES__ That little chicken is hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ You know Trolls was recently added as well, right??"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! I've already played it, but it's not my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty cute and colorful though."
"__MOVIES__ This is true, probably geared more towards the younger kids."
