"__BASKETBALL__ Kevin Durant was on fire last night. Did you see the game?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Nah. My mother-in-law came over and we all went out to dinner."
"__BASKETBALL__ You missed a decent game, bro."
"__BASKETBALL__ How many points did Durant score?"
"__BASKETBALL__ 16 points in less than 3 minutes."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not too shabby."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I like to call him a 'stealth scorer'."
"__BASKETBALL__ You trademarked that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Haha. Not yet."
"__BASKETBALL__ So how many points did he end up with?"
"__BASKETBALL__ 33. That 16 was during the third quarter."
"__BASKETBALL__ I saw the recap on the news. The Warriors are about to sweep the Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ It looks that way. It's a bit disappointing, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ How come?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I prefer close games, especially during the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not a fan of blowouts, huh?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Never have been. It's like, no contest."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who knows. Maybe the Spurs will turn it around and tie-up the series."
"__BASKETBALL__ That would be awesome, but I doubt it'll happen."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too."
