"__COMEDY__ What do you think was the best time period for comedy movies?"
"__COMEDY__ I'd have to say probably mid to late nineties was when some of my favorite comedies came out."
"__COMEDY__ Yea? Like which movies?"
"__COMEDY__ I really like the older Jim Carrey stuff like Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura, Pet Detective."
"__COMEDY__ Yes! Those are classics...I must have watched and re-watched those so many times as a kid."
"__COMEDY__ Yea, comedies were so like silly and stupid back then. Nowadays everything is just super crude and sexual."
"__COMEDY__ I know, it's like all these comedies nowadays are competing to see who can push the envelope the most and show the grossest, most outrageous thing."
"__COMEDY__ Yea, I haven't seen a really good comedy that I really enjoyed in recent memory."
"__COMEDY__ Like I said before, all the best comedies were made in the 90's."
"__COMEDY__ This is true. Now I want to re-watch some of them!"
