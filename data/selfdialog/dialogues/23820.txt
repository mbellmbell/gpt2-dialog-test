"__SUPERHERO__ Do you consider The Mask to be a superhero movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oooh, that one is tough. I'm not sure."
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't think it is. He doesn't have any super powers."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, the powers are the mask. It's more of a magic movie."
"__SUPERHERO__ It's listed as a superhero flick though."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'll buy it as one, but with reservations."
"__SUPERHERO__ He's barely a hero, too. He's kind of a jerk the whole film, and it's too silly."
"__SUPERHERO__ Plus, the focus is on the mask. If Iron Man was all about the armor, or if they did a movie entirely on Thor's hammer, then it would be the same."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, Black Widow and Hawkeye are superheroes but they don't have any powers."
"__SUPERHERO__ True, but they're highly-trained assassins. Jim Carrey's character is not."
