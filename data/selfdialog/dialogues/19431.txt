"__MOVIES__ Hey, remember when we used to go to the movies all the time together?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those were the good old days."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I was thinking, do you want to start doing it again, even if it's once a year?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I do, is there anything good coming out this year?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'm super excited for It to come out."
"__MOVIES__ Me too man, I think it has potential to be one of the greatest book adaptations."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the original It movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I loved it!  It wasn't as scary as I was hoping."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  I just watched it the other week after not seeing it for like 10 years."
"__MOVIES__ How'd that go?"
"__MOVIES__ It made me realize how cheesy it was."
"__MOVIES__ Haha, I've had that happen a couple times rewatching old movies."
"__MOVIES__ But, after watching the trailers for the new ones, I don't think I could be more excited."
"__MOVIES__ I know man!  Pennywise looks super creepy."
"__MOVIES__ I just heard they're making it rated R too, so that made me even more excited."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's great news.  I feel like they held back a lot in the original."
"__MOVIES__ I know!  The book is so violent, and I didn't get that feeling from the original."
"__MOVIES__ Now you've got me super excited, when does it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ September 8!  You down to go?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! I'll put it in my calendar right now."
