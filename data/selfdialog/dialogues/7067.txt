"__ICEHOCKEY__ So Marcie, uh, I was wondering. Would you like to go to the Sharks game with me?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The Sharks? That's ice hockey, isn't it?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes it is. It's our own San Jose team."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Um, isn't ice hockey sort of violent?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, not really. it's an exciting, fast-moving game of skill, actually."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Then why do they tell that joke?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What joke?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I bet you know. I went to a fight, and..."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ ...a game of ice hockey broke out."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You have heard it!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yeah. My grandfather told me that joke."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ha-ha. I've never seen a game."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I have really good seats. Right down behind the shield."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The shield. That's reassuring."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You'll like it, I promise. And if you don't we'll leave."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Wow. How can I turn you down?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ So you'll come."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Of course I will."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Want me to pick you up?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nah. I'll meet you at the Arena. I want to locate all the emergency exits."
