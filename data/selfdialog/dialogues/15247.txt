"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah. Half-Blood Prince was my favorite."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I was sad when Dumbledore died."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So was I, but I had just read the book so I was expecting it."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I also really liked the first movie."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think that was the movie that best captured the book."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Agreed. What was your favorite thing the movie did that the book didn't."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The music. That tone will forever play in my head when I think of Harry Potter."
