"__STAR_WARS__ Hey, do you want to see that upcoming Star Wars film?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Last Jedi? Yeah, I'm quite excited about it, I am going to see it on opening day."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. It looks do dark and interesting like the Empire Strikes Back. Do you feel the same way?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but I'm more interested in what they'll do with Luke Skywalker. We haven't seen him in over 20 years."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I wish they had kept Han Solo alive long enough for him and Luke to meet again."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree, it would have been great to see Luke, Han, and Leia be with each other one more time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the new characters too, though. I am quite partial to Kylo Ren."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like Kylo also, and I like Finn as well. My favorite character is probably Rey though."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought they did a lot of good with Rey in The Force Awakens. I hope they continue with her in the new movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can't wait to see all of our favorite characters together again in The Last Jedi."
