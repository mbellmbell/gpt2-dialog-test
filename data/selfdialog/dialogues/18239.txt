"__MOVIES__ Do you like Seth Rogan movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I like a few. Sausage Party was pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I liked Sausage Party, but it will never top Superbad."
"__MOVIES__ Superbad? Which movie was that one?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a group of friends trying to buy beer and get laid."
"__MOVIES__ Who stars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Jonah Hill and Michael Cera. But Seth Rogan makes an appearance too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I think I've heard of that one."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of my favorite movies. Have you seen Knocked Up?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and I really had a good time at that movie."
"__MOVIES__ Then you'll really like Superbad! It has the same humor"
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to check out Superbad then. I like anything Jonah Hill is in."
"__MOVIES__ You won't be disappointed!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Pineapple Express?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think James Franco was great in it."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of Seth Rogan's best movies personally speaking."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's good. But not as good as Superbad."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't know, since I haven't seen it yet."
"__MOVIES__ You should check it out. It's just as good, if not better, than Sausage Party"
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like a good movie"
