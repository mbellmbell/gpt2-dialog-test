"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you like hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No way! It's too violent and dangerous!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think it's as dangerous as football, sure, but I think a lot of the violence is for show."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Why do you think all the violence isn't real?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Our town used to have a minor league team, and I went to a lot of games. And without fail, every game, one of the players would get into a fight and get so mad he tore his shirt off."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're kidding, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, seriously, they would pretend to have a big fight and the refs would get involved, and the star player would get sent to the penalty box and be so angry he took his shirt off."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't think I've ever been so angry I felt the urge to strip!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I know, right? It was just to show off his athletic build, entertain the fans, and especially get the women more involved in rooting for a certain team or certain players."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ But nobody ever got seriously hurt?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No. It would looks incredibly painful, like somebody was slammed into the wall or the ice, or hit with a stick, but there were never any serious injuries. The players would be fine and just keep on playing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hockey seems like it would be difficult to follow."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It really isn't. The basic rules aren't that hard to learn, and it really has some similarities to sports like football or soccer."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I like football. Does a hockey game have four quarters and a halftime?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, hockey games have three periods. But in between the periods, there's usually something going on to amuse the fans, just like a halftime."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do hockey teams have cheerleaders who wear those skimpy outfits out onto the ice."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep. I don't know how they do it. But teams have cheerleaders and mascots just like in other sports, and they help pump up the fans."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The only place you can really watch a live hockey game is in Canada, right?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No! It's not like the teams are playing on frozen lakes. The game are held indoors on a man-made ice rink."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I never thought about people being able to play hockey even if they didn't live somewhere that gets freezing cold all the time!"
