"__THRILLER__ I saw a Nicole Kidman movie the other day with a really cool twist ending."
"__THRILLER__ Hmmmm, not sure what movie you are talking about."
"__THRILLER__ It's called The Others."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I gotcha.  Yeah, I remember that film."
"__THRILLER__ The ending was very creative, didn't you think?"
"__THRILLER__ How they didn't realize they were dead the whole time?"
"__THRILLER__ Right.  Didn't feel tacked on or out of place."
"__THRILLER__ Which is nice to see.  Way too many twist endings have a twist just for the sake of it."
"__THRILLER__ This one made complete sense and fit in with the scope of the film."
"__THRILLER__ Completely agree.  Was very well done by the filmmaker."
