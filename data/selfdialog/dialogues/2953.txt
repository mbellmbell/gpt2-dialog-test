"__MUSIC__ Hey man, what do you think about Metallica?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't really know much about them."
"__MUSIC__ Well they are one of the best heavy metal bands of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  I seem to recall hearing some of their songs back in the 90's on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the 90's are known as their sell out period."
"__MUSIC__ Sell out?  What was wrong with their 90's music?"
"__MUSIC__ If you never heard their classics from the 80s I suppose Metallica's music from the 90's is OK."
"__MUSIC__ 'Enter Sandman' was a very popular song!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, hahahaha, if you think so.  I think it was average at best."
"__MUSIC__ Well I don't know why you are hating on a popular song of theirs!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm telling you if you have not heard their 80's music you have not heard Metallica at their best!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, what should I listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there are 4 key albums that you must listen to. They are 'Kill 'Em All', 'Ride the Lightning', 'Master of Puppets' and 'And Justice for All'"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, why did you say and twice?"
"__MUSIC__ And is part of the title of 'And Justice for All'.  Got it?"
"__MUSIC__ Got it.  Should I listen in any certain order?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, in the order I gave the titles to you earlier."
"__MUSIC__ Why listen to their music in that order?"
"__MUSIC__ That is in the order the albums were released.  You can hear how they start out and peak with 'And Justice for All'."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I will give Metallica's early works a listen.  Thanks for the info man!"
