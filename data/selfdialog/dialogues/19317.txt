"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Fury?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the Brad Pitt movie with the tanks set during World War 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes that's the movie. Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pena are also in there."
"__MOVIES__ What other movies has Jon Bernthal been in? I know the other actors."
"__MOVIES__ He was in Wolf of Wallstreet, remember he was the one with the European girlfriend who was smuggling in the goods with her through luggage."
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's right! He was the tough guy who hated Jonah Hill's character."
"__MOVIES__ He's been getting a lot of roles of late. He was really good in Fury as one of the four that was in Brad Pitt's tank."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked that movie. I haven't seen a movie do tank warfare as well as that one. It was really intense watching those tank battles against the Axis forces."
"__MOVIES__ I liked the team aspect and character growth of the characters. Especially with Logan's character. I always feel he's under appreciated as a young actor."
"__MOVIES__ Logan's really good at playing the quiet, meek, characters. I feel it suits his true persona well."
"__MOVIES__ He was really good in Perks of Being a Wallflower."
"__MOVIES__ That's the movie based off the book and it stars Emma Watson too right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah Emma Watson was really good in there, it was good to see her doing something after all the Hermione Granger roles from Harry Potter."
"__MOVIES__ I think she's a good actress too but I might be biased because I'm a huge Harry Potter fan."
"__MOVIES__ I want to see her do more action films, she does a lot of serious drama's and more time period pieces."
"__MOVIES__ She was in this Ethan Hawke movie called Regression, it was really suspenseful."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that one, was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was interesting. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't a routine crime movie. It had some horror elements."
"__MOVIES__ That's sounds intriguing. I think I'll have to look that up because I love Ethan Hawke too. Should be good to see how they perform together."
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of a hard movie to watch because she's a victim, and then something else. I want ruin it, but check it out for yourself."
