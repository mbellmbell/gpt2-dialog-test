"__STAR_WARS__ Imagine what it would like in the Star Wars universe. What if you're a regular guy who just finds a light saber on the ground."
"__STAR_WARS__ With how often the Jedi lose them, it probably happens a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ The guy probably hang it on his wall at home."
"__STAR_WARS__ He tells the girls he brings home, 'Yeah. i killed a jedi and took his saber.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ He'd probably end up lopping off an arm at some point."
"__STAR_WARS__ His? Or someone else's?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Depends on how drunk he is, I'd imagine."
"__STAR_WARS__ How do you explain that to the doctor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ 'Dang jedi just walked up and took my arm off!'"
"__STAR_WARS__ They're all robot doctors. I don't know if they'd buy that."
