"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So football season is coming up. Are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely!  Even after last year, when the Falcons chocked so badly"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, that was one for the record books!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I doubt that will game will ever be forgotten"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Patriots are going to take it all again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they'll make a good run, but no one is on top forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good point, and no one is always a loser"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And THAT'S why I'm still an Atlanta fan!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha!  Okay, but it's probably not their season this year either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who are you watching, other than the Pats?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers look very interesting this time around"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah?  Didn't their owner just die?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but their defense this year is AMAZING"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking at the Seahawks this year.  Their defense will also be very strong"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Seattle has really put effort into building"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're hungry for another bite of the apple after last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking about a comeback, Sports Illustrated has a lot of faith in Greenbay this time around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they've put a lot of work on their offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they have some ground to make up!"
