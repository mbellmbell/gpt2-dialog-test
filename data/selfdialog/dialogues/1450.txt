"__MUSIC__ I heard Modest Mouse will be playing here in September. Probably my favorite indie post-rock band."

"__MUSIC__ That's a good one, probably the album that made them really popular."
"__MUSIC__ I liked Sad Sappy Sucker too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes. You know who else you might like? Courtney Barnett."
"__MUSIC__ Who is that?"

"__MUSIC__ Is she a solo artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much. A singer-songwriter."
"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to think of something I've heard by her."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I think her most well-known track is If You Can't See Me I Can't See You."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I've heard that. Kind of urbane and witty."
"__MUSIC__ Her latest single is called How to Boil an Egg."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like the Seinfeld of alt-rock. Songs about everyday stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and she has a lovely, clear, stong voice."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check that out."
"__MUSIC__ I think you'll enjoy her songs -- great sounds for laundry day, driving, cooking, etc."
"__MUSIC__ So are you going to the Modest Mouse concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, if I'm not travelling for work at the time."
"__MUSIC__ If you aren't travelling, let's go together."
