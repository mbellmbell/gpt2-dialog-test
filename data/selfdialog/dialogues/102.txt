"__MUSIC__ Hi, long time no see.  Are you still into that singer, what's her name?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean Adele?  Yes!  I love her music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah!  I understand she's done really well all over the world."
"__MUSIC__ Indeed.  She won a whole bunch of Grammys last year."
"__MUSIC__ I saw that show.  She was so beautiful.  And sang so well."
"__MUSIC__ I love the way she is so classy."
"__MUSIC__ It is nice to bring class back to music again.  I hate some of the singers that swear and stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yup.  How much can you love someone who hits it big with a song with a title of 'HELLO'?"
"__MUSIC__ Gee, could it be simpler?  And it's such a beautiful song."
"__MUSIC__ She doesn't need all the fireworks and huge sound effects and stuff to keep an audience, does she?"
"__MUSIC__ No, just a piano and a microphone works for her."
"__MUSIC__ She relates so well to the audience, too."
"__MUSIC__ I understand she went to the firehouse in London to visit with the firefighters after the big apartment fire there."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  She just walked in.  She wanted to tell them how much she appreciated what they did."
"__MUSIC__ Gosh, not very many stars do that kind of stuff."
"__MUSIC__ No.  She seems to be really down to earth."
"__MUSIC__ That's part of what I like about her."
"__MUSIC__ That and her voice?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  She sings like an angel.  Do you think we will ever be able to get tickets?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  But if we can, can I go with you?"
