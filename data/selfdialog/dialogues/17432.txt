"__MOVIES__ Are you going to watch movies tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ I want to, but I've seen all the new ones. Do you have any recommendations?"
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen the movie 'Drive'?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Is it a new one?"
"__MOVIES__ It's kind of old. It came out in 2011."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I've seen that one. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It stars Ryan Gosling as a getaway driver for robberies and he also is a stunt driver in Hollywood."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting. I don't think I saw that. How is the plot?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a typical plot. The driver falls in love with a girl and has to protect her and her family from some mafioso guys."
"__MOVIES__ It's a simple I idea, but I like those kinds of plots. Is the acting good?"
"__MOVIES__ It has a pretty decent cast, and they do a pretty good job. Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman are the mafioso guys."
"__MOVIES__ Albert Brooks? That's different."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The movie has a very unique feel to it."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ The music score is more dramatic and has a retro/European feel to it rather than the typical stuff."
"__MOVIES__ That could be good or not. I would have to hear it to appreciate it."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. The characters are not the typical tough guys or action heros. They seem more like real people, which makes it a better movie."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good."
"__MOVIES__ Also, the tenderness and shyness of the main character toward the female love interest is unique and feels genuine."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like a really interesting movie."
