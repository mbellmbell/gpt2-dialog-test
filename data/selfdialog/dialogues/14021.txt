"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs just have too much firepower"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, as much as I love Isiah Thomas, he doesn't have enough help"
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean the Cavs are just bullying them"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think the Cavs ever took the Celtics seriously"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't believe they did either."
"__BASKETBALL__ Watching these games feels like a scrimmage"
"__BASKETBALL__ I mean they were beating this team by 41 points at one time"
"__BASKETBALL__ On their home court!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly! This seems like practice for the Cavs"
"__BASKETBALL__ So that they can get ready for the real series against the Warriors"
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree with you. This was fine tuning for the Cavs"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's why the Celtics should have made some deals during the trade deadline."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah if they could have added another star, it could've made a difference"
"__BASKETBALL__ But for now they are over matched and overwhelmed."
"__BASKETBALL__ For sure. I mean they have had a great season"
"__BASKETBALL__ Especially considering the tragedy that Isiah Thomas went through."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know how he played so well after his sister died."
