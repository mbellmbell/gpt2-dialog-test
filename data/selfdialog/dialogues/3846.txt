"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to AFI?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes.  I've heard some of their more recent stuff."
"__MUSIC__ You should check out their older music.  It's really great."
"__MUSIC__ What albums do you recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ The Art of Drowning and Black Sails in the Sunset."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ Melodic punk, kind of.  They've really changed their sound over the years."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well they started off as a straight punk band and made their way all the way to electronic music."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I had no idea they were a punk band."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you'd really have no idea, looking at them now.  I mean, five years ago Davey Havok was wearing blue eyeshadow and fake lashes."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's an interesting guy, that's for sure."
"__MUSIC__ He evolves with his music.  He looked totally different when they first started versus The Art of Drowning versus Sing the Sorrow versus DecemberUnderground."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they sound like a really progressive band, on many levels."
"__MUSIC__ They are.  But their best music was definitely during the Black Sails/Art of Drowning days.  I highly recommend it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not too into punk music, do you think I'll like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's MUCH more melodic than regular punk.  I'm not such a fan of pure punk myself."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, well I'll give it a shot."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely.  If you don't like it, try Sing the Sorrow.  It's much more pop-ish."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I will.  Thanks!"
