"__MOVIES__ What was one of your favorite movies when you were a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like The Black Cauldron."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love that movie! That one was so good!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's one of my favorite movies actually, it's a classic."
"__MOVIES__ What do you like most about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I like how dark it is for a Disney movie, it's probably the most dark out of all the others they've done."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that's for sure, very dark indeed."
"__MOVIES__ I also like all the classic fantasy elements, like magic and dragons and an evil king."
"__MOVIES__ That was always fun to watch, it made you feel like you were in a different world."
"__MOVIES__ It was very convincing when you were little, you felt lost in it."
"__MOVIES__ I certainly did, but I was scared of the Horned King to death."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, he was a very scary Disney villain."
"__MOVIES__ His face was like a skeleton and he had red eyes, very spooky."
"__MOVIES__ His voice was also very creepy and loud."
"__MOVIES__ I think the whole idea of him bringing back an army of the dead is really cool, but scary."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, when you're that young it's the kind of stuff that gives you nightmares."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think I ever had any nightmares about that movie."
"__MOVIES__ I certainly did, the little dragons that chase the pig around scared me."
"__MOVIES__ They did? That's funny."
"__MOVIES__ It definitely wasn't funny for me, that's a very scary movie when you're a kid."
