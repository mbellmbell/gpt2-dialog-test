"__MOVIES__ So, what do you think of the Transformers movies?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, I thought the first wasn't too bad, and the second had some decent action scenes, but then after that, the last too REALLY went downhill."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, they were just WAAAY too long for starters, especially part 3.  It was like, what nearly three hours I think?"
"__MOVIES__ I think like two and half, but yeah..."
"__MOVIES__ And they just pretty much recycled the same plot over and over 'So BIG thing is threatening everyone, oh no!' And I've just never really liked the way the Transformers have looked."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?  I thought some of them looked pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ Well, a lot of them it's just like they got too many gears and extra crap on them, and the action is paced so bad it's hard to tell who's doing what to who."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it does get kind of confusing sometimes."
"__MOVIES__ Not to mention with how little characterization any of the characters are given it really makes it hard for me to care about anyone."
"__MOVIES__ What you mean you didn't care Shia's character?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I think I wanted him to die a few times during the first three films."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think Mark Walhberg was an improvement?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh... I don't know.. wasn't really much there.  And it's Wahlberg.  I mean, he can be good if given the right role, but here's it's like 'Guys.. I'm an inventor! I invent stuff!'  Yeah, sure, pal..."
"__MOVIES__ Hahaha."
"__MOVIES__ And then there's that whole scene where his daughter's boyfriend goes on and on about how he can legally bang her because of the 'Romeo and Juliet' law.. it's like what??"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that kinda... weird.."
"__MOVIES__ I mean, just make the character 18 and we can still have her father and her boyfriend fighting w/o all the creepy subtext."
"__MOVIES__ Weird how Michael Bay seems know so much about that law, huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I've heard some rumors..."
