"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think are the greatest football players of all time?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which position?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any of them, but let's start with quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, for starters, Tom Brady might be the GOAT."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think he is greater than Joe Montana?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think his last superbowl definitely put him over the edge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who else would you put on that list?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I think Montana, of course, and also players like Elway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Elway is phenomenal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but he doesn't have as many rings as those other guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well what about Staubach and Manning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those guys are great - Manning got a ring on his way out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but of course they probably don't stand up to Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady has just been too good for too long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I agree, but stability and coaching have helped."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they have - they are consistently great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So how is Brady going to do this year, will he slow down?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe a little, but he will be a force, as usual."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady is the greatest quarterback of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I agree."
