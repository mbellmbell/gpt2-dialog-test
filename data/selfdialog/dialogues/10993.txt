"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the NFL's rules?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they've gotten too restrictive over the past few years and I'm glad they're relaxing their stance a bit"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, the excessive celebration penalty is itself pretty excessive"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like seeing players celebrate, but I understand the reason for it"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't like watching players on teams I don't like celebrate, like Antonio Brown on the Steelers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure but that doesn't mean that players shouldn't be able to celebrate more in general"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think the celebrations have to be classy, and they can still be flashy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish they'd relax more on the goal post celebrations that Jimmy Graham popularized"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They cracked down on that because he kept hitting the posts and making them have to readjust them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That one makes more sense, whereas other celebrations that don't disrupt the game should be left intact"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some players got away with a lot, like Marshawn Lynch grabbing his crotch as he jumped into the end zone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It may have been in bad taste, but I don't think most people would object to it on the grounds that it was entertaining"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point, since the NFL is a source of entertainment, and it should be entertaining"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, and that's why those rules were getting out of hand"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some players have come up with iconic celebrations, like Victor Cruz doing a salsa dance in the end zone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man I miss Victor Cruz dancing in the end zone"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, and I hope he does really well on the Bears, even though I'm not a huge Bears fan"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's fine to be a fan of a player even if you aren't a fan of the team they're on"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Case in point, Jimmy Graham, who went from the Saints--one of my favorites--to the Seahawks, my least favorite team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they just have better goal posts in Seattle that are harder to knock out of alignment"
