"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Guardians of the Galaxy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I saw it at the Drive-in!"
"__MOVIES__ How did you think Chris Pratt did?"
"__MOVIES__ His acting was great!"
"__MOVIES__ I think he really fits the role as Star Lord."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  I think he did even better in this movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite character from the series?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like Gamora's character, she just seems so complex."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she definitely is, but I think Groot is my favorite!"
"__MOVIES__ Why is Groot your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I just think he brings a perfect amount of comedy in the tough situations."
"__MOVIES__ I definitely get that, but I think Rocket kind of does that too."
"__MOVIES__ To some extent, but I'm impressed by Groot, because he doesn't really even talk."
"__MOVIES__ Well he does talk, just hardly anyone can understand him."
"__MOVIES__ I still can't believe that Groot sacrificed himself in the first movie to save the others."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that makes him really awesome and such a great character."
"__MOVIES__ I also couldn't believe he was voiced by Vin Deisel"
"__MOVIES__ I thought that was a great choice!"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely, because he was super big and awesome before going back to being baby Groot"
"__MOVIES__ That's true! He's definitely super cool as a character!"
