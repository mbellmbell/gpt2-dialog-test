"__DISNEY__ So what's your favorite Disney song?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know, there are so many. How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, since you asked; I would have to say the entire soundtrack of 'The Little Mermaid!'"
"__DISNEY__ Well, you said which 'song'. Not which soundtrack. Just reminding you."
"__DISNEY__ Okay, well then; I liked 'Part of Your World'  best.  She was so sad down beneath the sea with her collection of sunken treasures."
"__DISNEY__ Your right.  Maybe too sad for me though. I liked ' Under the Sea'.  Sebastian and all of the other sea creatures were jamming out."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Sebastian was too worried all of the time."
"__DISNEY__ That's because Ariel was such a rebel."
"__DISNEY__ You're right. That's why I like her.  She reminds me of , well, me!"
"__DISNEY__ You wish!"
