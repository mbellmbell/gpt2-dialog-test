"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, how is your team gearing up for the new NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you know I am a Patriots fan, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. How do you think they are going to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easy, they are going to repeat! No question in my mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that is pretty confident when we have a whole season to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is, but I think that will the personnel and coaches we have it should be in the bag."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know that I would be so confident. There are some other teams that look pretty good this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are, but are there any that can match up to the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that the Cowboys have a good shot this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I mean, I know they have potential to be good, but I don't think they will be the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that they are going to suprise people and be in the hunt at the end of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are you so sure of that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same reason as you. They have good personnel and coaches."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will have to see how it shakes out. Dak Prescott is pretty good, I will give you that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw something saying the top three teams likely to play in the Super Bowl are the Patriots, the Packers, and the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to see any of them, as long as the Pats are there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see, I feel like this season will be full of suprises."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I could see that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love to see my Chiefs sneak up on people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a chance. They had a decent year last year."
