"__MUSIC__ Have you ever listened to Liv Kristine?"

"__MUSIC__ Are any of her solo songs any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep. I really like most of the songs from her album Deus Ex Machina."
"__MUSIC__ It is metal like Cradle of Filth?"
"__MUSIC__ The genre is rock, but it doesn't sound like anything you hear on the radio. It's very good."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to listen to it sometime."
"__MUSIC__ Is metal your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I like all genres, but metal is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Are there any metal bands you would recommend?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Black Label Society. Their song Suicide Messiah is great."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh. I love that song."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard any of their other songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I really like Spread Your Wings and Say What You Will."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. The singer's voice of Black Label Society kind of reminds me of the singer's voice in the band Disturbed."
"__MUSIC__ They both have really unique voices."
"__MUSIC__ I know. They are both deep, as well."
