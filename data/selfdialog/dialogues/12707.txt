"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your biggest fear when it comes to LeVeon Bell getting a new deal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am like coach Tomlin and I don't live in my fears, man"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd be willing to pay that much for what he brings to the table."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they work something out..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ God I hope so"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only thing is that he's shown a lack of discipline twice and hurt the team with drug-related suspensions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup.That will always make me worry about a guy's professionalism and commitment after he's paid big money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes...Leveon is the most important player on our offense aside from Ben."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Bell will get 11 million a year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But whether it is with us or another team next year is the question."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have no fear that Bell will perform as an elite back when healthy and available."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Future injuries are what I worry about."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He willll still do better than most rbs, but it's a tough job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They usually burn out at 30."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he will last longer than that though"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ RB is a position that takes a lot of abuse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Guys don't last very long there and Bell has a history of injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah...I think one more injury and he is done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Please do not say that...lol"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sorry, just the cynic in me."
