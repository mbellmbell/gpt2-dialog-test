"__MOVIES__ I have a question about The Empire Strikes back."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember the scene where Luke goes in the cave, fights Vader, and is revealed to be himself under the helmet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, what about it?"
"__MOVIES__ What did that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It meant that Luke had to deal with the temptation of the Dark Side."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Vader already knows Luke is his son before they fight."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok."
"__MOVIES__ So Vader uses this by tempting Luke to join him and overthrow the Emperor."
"__MOVIES__ But doesn't the Emperor suspect this."
"__MOVIES__ Of course, he's a Sith and they do this all the time."
"__MOVIES__ Then why doesn't the Emperor kill Vader and take Luke instead?"
"__MOVIES__ He actually considers it when Vader and Luke fight."
"__MOVIES__ When does he do that?"
"__MOVIES__ He told Luke he felt the anger in him when fleet attacked the Death Star in Return of the Jedi."
"__MOVIES__ So it didn't matter to the Emperor if Vader lived or dies?"
"__MOVIES__ Not at all."
"__MOVIES__ The Dark side is complicated."
"__MOVIES__ Not really, just absolute."
