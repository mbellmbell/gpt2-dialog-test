"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes when I was younger. I liked it."
"__DISNEY__ I loved that movie. I loved that she was so empowered."
"__DISNEY__ I think it has a joan of ark theme to it."
"__DISNEY__ How so? Didn't joan her the voice of god?"
"__DISNEY__ She did. I think they are similar in a female dresses up as a male to be in a combat situation."
"__DISNEY__ That is very true. Never thought of that."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if Disney drew directly on joan for this Mulan character plot."
"__DISNEY__ It was actually based on the legend of Hua Mulan."
"__DISNEY__ I never realized that. Pretty neat. Maybe lots of women had to conceal themselves to have more rights back in the day."
