"__MUSIC__ What band did you like when you were in college?"
"__MUSIC__ I went through a few different phases."
"__MUSIC__ What were the phases?"
"__MUSIC__ When I started school I loved Radiohead."
"__MUSIC__ Why did you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ OK Computer was the first album I really latched onto in a 'this changed my life' way. Now I think that's super juvenile, though."
"__MUSIC__ How long did you like them?"
"__MUSIC__ Until a little after Kid A came out. I didn't like it very much."
"__MUSIC__ What other bands did you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I went through a heavy Neil Young phase."
"__MUSIC__ That's an interesting choice."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was really into biographies and read that book about him, Shakey by Jimmy McDonough."
"__MUSIC__ You read the book before you liked the music?"
"__MUSIC__ Correct. I got into his work with Crazy Horse and got really into it. I bought a ton of his CDs in a couple of year span."
"__MUSIC__ What did you like about him?"
"__MUSIC__ His stuff is just really... real, for lack of a better word."
"__MUSIC__ What was his best period?"
"__MUSIC__ The timeframe from 1969's 'Everybody Knows This is Nowhere' to 1978's 'Rust Never Sleeps' is, to me, unparallelled in music history. His early 1990s resurgence is good work, too, but if you want the best stuff it's the '60s and '70s you want."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll check it out!"
"__MUSIC__ His stuff was removed from Spotify for a while but it was back the last time I checked."
