"__MUSIC__ It is so good to enjoy music you haven't heard in so long."
"__MUSIC__ What brought that on? Are you listening to something right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep I just put on Seals and Crofts Greatest Hits. It was one of my favorite albums as a teenager."
"__MUSIC__ They were so different and yet some how familiar at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it had something to do with their belief in the Baha'i faith. Peaceful guys."
"__MUSIC__ I am not familiar with that religion."
"__MUSIC__ Wow I am listening to them right now and HummingBird is playing and out of the corner of my eye I see movement and it's a humming bird at one of my flowers!"
"__MUSIC__ How fun! You are so lucky like that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh and another Greatest Hits album that I used to listen to was Jim Croce."
"__MUSIC__ Mr Bad Bad Leroy Brown himself!"
"__MUSIC__ Time in a Bottle was probably my favorite song on that album"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm...I would have to go with Photographs and Memories for my pick."
"__MUSIC__ You know most people are going to say that what ever decade they were a teenager in is the one with the best music. I have to disagree."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but it's understandable why they would. So many things are influencing your emotions at that time."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I like music from the Big Band era as well as Motown from the 60' and 70's."
"__MUSIC__ So you are an exception to that observation."
"__MUSIC__ My husband is much younger than me and he has always loved '70's music and he wasn't born until 1980."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Back to work for me break time is over. 'Workin' 9 to 5' (yes i am singing the song!)"
"__MUSIC__ You never stop with the punny stuff! Bye"
