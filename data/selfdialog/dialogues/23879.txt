"__SUPERHERO__ Here's the thing, Batman Returns is a crime drama and its success as a film hinges on that fact."
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe, but I always kind of thought it hinged on Heath Ledger's performance, more than anything."
"__SUPERHERO__ Ledger's performance was obviously important, but that just goes to further prove my point."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, he was the main criminal, granted, but without the costumes, capes and gadgets I think it would have been far less successful."
"__SUPERHERO__ That's creating a false dichotomy, because Batman has always been a detective and the Joker has always been a criminal."
"__SUPERHERO__ But, does it hang together without all of the outrageous flavor of the comic book world?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I think that characterization would be the necessary ingredient for that to be the case and it just so happens that these characters are from the world of DC Comics."
"__SUPERHERO__ It's like a mash up of all the hope and altruism of the superhero genre, meeting head on with the cynicism and amorality of Crime Noir."
"__SUPERHERO__ Except, Batman never loses hope, or gives in to that cynical viewpoint."
"__SUPERHERO__ No, that part is embodied by others, namely the Joker, which is why I was right and Heath Ledger's performance is the integral ingredient."
