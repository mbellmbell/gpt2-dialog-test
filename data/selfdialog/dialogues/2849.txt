"__MUSIC__ So what kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I'll listen to anything, really."
"__MUSIC__ As long as it's a good song, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly."
"__MUSIC__ I'm the same way. I'll listen to anything from classical to rap music."
"__MUSIC__ I don't usually listen to the radio that much, though."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. Lately, I've actually been listening to a little heavy metal."
"__MUSIC__ There are so many kinds. Which kind do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Nothing to dark or heavy. Mostly those old hair bands from back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, do you mean those old bands like Metallica from the '80s?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! Do you listen to that stuff at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes; not usually, though."
"__MUSIC__ You're not really a heavy metal fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I like it. I've just been listening to stuff like Rage Against the Machine when I want to listen to something loud."
"__MUSIC__ I love Rage."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's a shame they're not together anymore,"
"__MUSIC__ Some of them got together last summer for a collaboration project."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. They toured with someone from Public Enemy, I believe."
"__MUSIC__ None of it's the same without the frontman Zack."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. He was really the sound of Rage Against the Machine."
