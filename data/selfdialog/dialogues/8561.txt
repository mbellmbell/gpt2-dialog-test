"__BEATLES__ There is going to be a fireworks game set to the Beatles' music after the baseball game Friday night."
"__BEATLES__ Really?  I've never really been into them very much."
"__BEATLES__ I know what you mean.  I am having a hard time picturing fireworks going off to their music."
"__BEATLES__ It would be slow.  I guess you could do a set with Hard Day's Night."
"__BEATLES__ True, or Eight Days a Week."
"__BEATLES__ Those are basically the only two I can think of that are a little fast."
"__BEATLES__ The main song i think of when I think of them is Yesterday."
"__BEATLES__ That and Norwegian Wood."
"__BEATLES__ Both of those are just way to slow and a little down."
"__BEATLES__ I may not stay for the fireworks since I'll have to listen to Beatles's music."
