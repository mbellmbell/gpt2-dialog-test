"__BASEBALL__ What do you think about instant replay?"
"__BASEBALL__ I think as long as we use human umpires, instant replay needs to keep being used in order to get the calls correct."
"__BASEBALL__ You want to take the human element out of it?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I just want calls to be correct. If a guy is safe, and is called out because the umpire was out of position, that is ridiculous."
"__BASEBALL__ But eventually won't that lead to all umpires being replaced by robots?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure, and I'm fine with that."
"__BASEBALL__ How could you say that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, the game is still being played by humans."
"__BASEBALL__ But, jobs..."
"__BASEBALL__ They aren't worthy of their jobs. They mess them up constantly."
"__BASEBALL__ I disagree."
"__BASEBALL__ Seriously? Answer me this question:"
"__BASEBALL__ Okay."
"__BASEBALL__ You know how the strike zone 'expands' under a lot of umpires with two strikes, or two outs, or late in the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah."
"__BASEBALL__ Why should that exist? The strike zone is the strike zone. It doesn't expand or contract."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that's true. I hate seeing balls WAY out of the zone called as strikes because of the situation."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the only thing human umpires should be used for is to break up fights and set things in motion."
"__BASEBALL__ For that, they can just use hired security."
"__BASEBALL__ True. No more umpires!"
