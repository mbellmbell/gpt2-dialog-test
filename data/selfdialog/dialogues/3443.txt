"__MUSIC__ Do you like David Bowie or Talking Heads better?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh -- Bowie was great!  He really could play all sorts of music."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like him better than Talking Heads?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I can't really say that.  I like the way Talking Heads incorporated all sorts of world music touches into their music."
"__MUSIC__ They both used Brian Eno as a producer at different times in their career. What do you think of him?"
"__MUSIC__ Eno is kind of abstract.  Talking Heads and David Bowie made more accessible music, in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ So. if you had to decide between them, which one would you pick?"
"__MUSIC__ I find Bowie easier to dance to.  He always manages to keep the beat going!"
"__MUSIC__ Then you would pick David Bowie?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the Talking Heads -- particularly on their last three albums, where they used *zouk* style rhythms -- made very danceable music."
"__MUSIC__ I'd agree with you there. Their first three albums are overly cerebral: too many self-aware lyrics, and too simplistic a musical style."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I think that's why Brian Eno picked both Bowie and the Talking Heads to produce: a simple musical style."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good point.  Eno liked to find a groove and build on it; it seems that a simple style would be more attractive to him."
"__MUSIC__ So -- between David Bowie and the Talking Heads, who would you choose?"
"__MUSIC__ I would go with the Talking Heads: I think that both their lyrical and musical style had more development over the course of their career."
"__MUSIC__ Wouldn't you agree, though, that Bowie's lyrics were more relevant to his audience throughout the years?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good point: he made alienation into a virtue, and yet always retained a strong sense of irony. Look at his last single: 'Lazarus'."
"__MUSIC__ Knowing what we know now -- that he was that close to death -- it must have taken some courage to address it head on like that."
"__MUSIC__ Musical courage -- I think that that really sums up David Bowie.  He never held back!"
"__MUSIC__ And that is, I think, why I would have to choose David Bowie over Talking Heads.  They were both really good, though."
