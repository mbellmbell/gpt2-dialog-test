"__STAR_WARS__ Did you ever get to see the Star Wars movie Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I did."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, all the Star War movies are great, but this one wasn't at all what I had expected."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know.  It was kind of cool seeing how the Death Star was created."
"__STAR_WARS__ But who would have thought the creator of the Death Star really didn't want to do it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like how they bring in strong female characters into the story line."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved Jyn's character, and how she was willing to do everything in her power to prove her father was a good man, and had made a way to destroy the Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also loved the way they tied it to Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know that the day we went to see it was the day Carrie Fisher passed away?"
