"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you like American football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love it! I am a big fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do you have a favorite team in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite team is the Cleveland Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Are you being serious or are you just joking around?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am totally serious."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow. Ok. I did not mean to be rude, it is just that I have seen the videos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What videos."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, the ones of the Browns fans tearing off their jerseys in the stands or staring off into space in disbelief as yet another game is lost."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are an exciting team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok.  And that is good. That is part of what makes watching football fun.  Every year is a new beginning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This was a good year for us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you figure?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, usually we win just enough games to ruin our draft picks. This year we didn't do that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I have to admit, you did get a lot of good draft picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it is really going to help us be competitive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are probably right, might really take hold in a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously, losing fifteen games was the best thing we could have done this year. We weren't going to win in the playoffs anyway and what does 8-8 do for us? Nothing.  We had a really good year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you say so, I mean you are the Browns fan, so you would know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You got that right."
