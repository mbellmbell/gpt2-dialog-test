"__BASEBALL__ Did you catch the game between the O's  and the blue jays"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah!"
"__BASEBALL__ It was a great game."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the O's  had that walk off homer at the bottom of the 10th"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I totally thought they'd give that game up."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they have been on a bit of a losing streak lately."
"__BASEBALL__ Their pitching needs some improvemeny."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree. They either hit well or pitch well. They can't seem to get it all together"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, it was awesome to see Castillo hit 2 homers throughout the game."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah that walk off homer was his first career homer."
"__BASEBALL__ Really? I didn't know that."
"__BASEBALL__ I thought good for him."
"__BASEBALL__ He's not the best defensive catcher, but the guy can hit."
"__BASEBALL__ I thought the same thing."
"__BASEBALL__ They've played 500 baseball so far this season."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah but it's still early. I wonder if they can really keep the pace for the season."
"__BASEBALL__ I know right? They made the playoffs last year but gave it up early on."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah well the pitching decision was the worst."
"__BASEBALL__ They should have bright in Britton. He wouldn't have cost us the game like that."
"__BASEBALL__ He rd he best saver in baseball right now in my opinion."
