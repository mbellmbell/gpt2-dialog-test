"__MOVIES__ You know what was actually really interesting in the film which was made possible because of the setting?"
"__MOVIES__ Hm, was it all of the old time weapons and odd western dialogue?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but those things were fun to see just as well as what I am about to tell you. Take one more guess."
"__MOVIES__ Did you get to see Jackson dress up in goofy clothes like Jamie Foxx did in Django?"
"__MOVIES__ Close, that is close enough. I will tell you- everyone was wearing winter clothes, and they looked really cool."
"__MOVIES__ What is so cool about winter clothes? Didn't people just wearing rugs and basically anything else they could back then to keep warm?"
"__MOVIES__ No way, there were tons of cool clothes back then just as there are now."
"__MOVIES__ What were they wearing?"
"__MOVIES__ For instance, and I think this is the best by far, Jackson was a former Union soldier, and he goes around wearing his old military uniform which was thick, made him look like a giant, and it had a cape."
"__MOVIES__ A cape like batman's?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it was this short yellow cape around his neck. Maybe it was not called a cape,  but it looked like one."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think that was cape, man."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know what it was, but it looked cool."
"__MOVIES__ You don't even know what you were looking at."
"__MOVIES__ That is not the point. Besides that, some of them had these unique looking furs which made them look like animals, especially the Mexican. You keep getting the feeling that the Mexican is going to whip out shotguns out from under his furs at any moment."
"__MOVIES__ Does he?"
"__MOVIES__ I am not going to spoil it for you."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that is fair enough- I do want to see the movie for myself after all. Any other cool costumes?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there was a moment in which one guy had to rip a rug off of a wall and wear it like a coat- I thought that was funny."
"__MOVIES__ Hah, I knew they were just wearing rugs!"
