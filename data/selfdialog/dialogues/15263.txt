"__HARRY_POTTER__ The first movie seems very kid-friendly to me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, you have to remember that the movies got darker as they went along."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why's that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The readers got older.  By the time they got to the end, they'd been at Hogwarts six years I think."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Guess that's true.  Still, it seemed too happy of a movie to me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He defeated that Voldemort-thingy in the guy's head. Who wouldn't be happy?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But he really didn't defeat him, he just came back again."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but Harry didn't know that.  He did what he had to."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It always seemed weird how Voldemort keep coming back."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Would have been hard making more movies if he didn't."
