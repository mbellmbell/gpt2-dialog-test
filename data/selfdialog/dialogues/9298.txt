"__BASEBALL__ Wow, there are a few surprises going on in baseball this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I am surprised how poorly the Cubs are doing."
"__BASEBALL__ How about those Milwaukee Brewers."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, as of today, they are actually leading their division."
"__BASEBALL__ I am not sure they will continue doing so well."
"__BASEBALL__ They seem to have the hitting but, pictching is not fantastic."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they have won 5 games in a row now."
"__BASEBALL__ Yes, I noticed they were actually a couple of games ahead of the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ Houston is another team that is surprising."
"__BASEBALL__ I noticed they have the best record in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ I know they have a pretty good pitching staff."
"__BASEBALL__ There hitting is also very good."
"__BASEBALL__ Those in the know say they will last."
"__BASEBALL__ Would not surprise me."
"__BASEBALL__ I noticed the Dodgers are doing as well as everyone had predicted."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I think they are only a couple of games above 500."
"__BASEBALL__ Who do you think is the best team in the American league?"
"__BASEBALL__ For me it is a toss up between the Astros and the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ I am not crazy about the rule changed that just allows you to walk a batter intentionally just by letting the umpire know."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't like it either. Takes away from some of the excitement of throwing 4 balls without throwing a passed ball."
