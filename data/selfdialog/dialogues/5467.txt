"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of Qui Con Jin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Obi Wan Kanobi's mentor?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the one that Liam Neesin plays."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not  think they explored him as well as they should have."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he was a real strong guy, really intense."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was the last of the old Jedi. I liked when he fought the SIth."
"__STAR_WARS__ In the moving doors, yes, so much patience in his fighting."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was more like a dance. I think it was foreshadowing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Of what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of what would happen to the Jedi if they lost their patience, how they would be killed."
