"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hey, did you get a chance to listen to my last mixtape?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I did."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What did you think?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Honestly, it just wasn't my taste."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Okay I can respect that."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's not a criticism of you, even within my favourite artists there will be songs or entire albums that I'l listen to and feel like if I never hear it again I'll be okay, and those are my favourite artists."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Like who?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Like Public Enemy. Their first studio album I thought didn't last long enough, but their next album was a struggle to get through and a relief when I finally finished it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well no offense taken, I'm just happy you gave it a fair shake."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah of course."
