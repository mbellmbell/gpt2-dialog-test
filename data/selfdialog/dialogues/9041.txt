"__BEATLES__ I just saw A Hard Day's Night on TV. I had forgotten how many good songs where in it."
"__BEATLES__ What is on that album. I forgot."
"__BEATLES__ Well there is the title song obviously, but also 'I Should Have Known Better'."
"__BEATLES__ Okay, what else?"
"__BEATLES__ I'm Happy Just to Dance with You and This Boy."
"__BEATLES__ This Boy? What's that?"
"__BEATLES__ That is the Ringo's theme from the  movie."
"__BEATLES__ I don't remember that one."
"__BEATLES__ It's on the Hard Day's Night album in North America, but not in the United Kingdom."
"__BEATLES__ Okay, maybe I should stream it and see if I remember it."
