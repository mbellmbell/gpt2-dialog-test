"__MOVIES__ Have you heard about the movie 'Get Out'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a lot of people have said it was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see it yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't gotten to see it yet. Don't spoil it for me!"
"__MOVIES__ I won't, but you should really go see it. I thought it was both entertaining and insightful."
"__MOVIES__ What did you find insightful about it?"
"__MOVIES__ There was a lot of really interesting social commentary regarding race relations, within the narrative of a horror story."
"__MOVIES__ How so? What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ This black guy goes home with his white girlfriend to meet her family, and it's just really uncomfortable. It kind of gets out of hand."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, don't tell me too much about the plot, but how does it comment on race relations?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the whole plot was really kind of a metaphor for the experience of black people in a majority-white country. It's both overtly and covertly hostile."
"__MOVIES__ How does that play out in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Many of the things that the white characters say and do are straight out of real life, but in the context of a horror movie, it's easier to see how damaging they are from the black protagonist's perspective."
"__MOVIES__ So you felt like you could understand what it's like to be black in America?"
"__MOVIES__ In some ways, yeah. It often seems like racism has mostly died out here. I never thought about how all of these experiences could add up to create a really hostile environment."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting. I'll have to check it out. Was it mostly horror or were there funny parts also?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it was definitely a comedy as well as a horror film. There's a lot of dark humor. No pun intended."
"__MOVIES__ I like dark humor, so that's probably right up my alley."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely! Go see it so we can talk more about the social commentary."
"__MOVIES__ I will try to see it this week!"
