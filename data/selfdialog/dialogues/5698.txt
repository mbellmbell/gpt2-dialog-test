"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the Star Wars film will ever have Yoda again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do not think so."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope they at least give him more of a back story."
"__STAR_WARS__ It would be very cool if he got his own movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ The movies do not even show what he is."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean what type of alien?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right, they say what Chewie is and so on."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the big world in the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ All the different types of people and creatures."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that is what makes the movies so good."
