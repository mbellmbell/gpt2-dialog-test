"__THRILLER__ What kind of thrillers do you like best?"
"__THRILLER__ I love Alfred Hitchcock movies. They are classic nail-biting, squirm in your seat suspense masterpieces."
"__THRILLER__ Do you have a favorite Hitchcock film?"
"__THRILLER__ I can't get down to one favorite, because he has done so many films that I love."
"__THRILLER__ Tell me about one of your favorites, then."
"__THRILLER__ To Catch a Thief with Cary Grant and Gracy Kelly is a sparkling combination of suspense and romance, thriller and comedy."
"__THRILLER__ Cary Grant and Hitchcock made several films together, didn't they?"
"__THRILLER__ All great, classic thrillers. To Catch a Thief is about an ex-jewel thief who is suspected of being behind a current rash of jewel thefts in France."
"__THRILLER__ But there's romance too, right?"
"__THRILLER__ Grace Kelly is one of the people who think Grant is guilty. The ending is a real nail biter, with Grant trying to finger the thief as the police try to shoot him!"
