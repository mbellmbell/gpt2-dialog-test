"__MOVIES__ Hey have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've been busy. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I've seen a bunch of good movies recently."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? Tell me about them."
"__MOVIES__ Well I recently watched a documentary called Dear Zachary."
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was about a guy who made a documentary for a child whose father had recently died."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the dad had a relationship with a woman who killed him then while in jail she found out she was pregnant."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my. That's really interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it gets way crazier too. You really should watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give it a try. Any other good documentaries you'd recommend?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! There was another one called Tickled."
"__MOVIES__ Tickled? What was that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was the craziest thing I have seen in a long time. It was about a tickling competition."
"__MOVIES__ A tickling competition? That sounds weird..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's really the only way to describe it without going too far into it."
"__MOVIES__ Was there a lot of twists and turns?"
"__MOVIES__ Like you wouldn't believe. Don't read anything about it, just watch it."
"__MOVIES__ I think that's the first thing I'll do when I go home."
