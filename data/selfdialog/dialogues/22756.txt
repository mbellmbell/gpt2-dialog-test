"__DISNEY__ Over the years, what has bene your favorite Disney franchise?"
"__DISNEY__ Iâ€™d have to say, Toy Story. Even as a grown adult, there is just something about those movies that are very charming."
"__DISNEY__ Do you think any part of it has to do with the nostalgic factor?"
"__DISNEY__ Perhaps a little bit, yes. That being said, I just think they are good movies, overall."
"__DISNEY__ I certainly see your point. Not only is the CGI on point, but I also love the voice cast and the story."
"__DISNEY__ Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have great chemistry, also, in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ I second that point, too. What was your favorite movie out of the three so far?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely, the first. The second was great, but I still think the original was the best."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I just think the flow of the first movie was the best, too."
"__DISNEY__ That being said, Toy Story was just a very well-done set of movies."
