"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Ayreon?"
"__MUSIC__ No. What kind of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly progressive rock and progressive metal. They just released a new album that I really enjoyed."
"__MUSIC__ What was the name of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ The album is called The Source. It follows a science fiction story in which the singers act out various characters."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds really interesting. Maybe I should listen to a few songs."
"__MUSIC__ I can recommend the song called The Source Will Flow. The video is pretty special too."
"__MUSIC__ What's so special about the video?"
"__MUSIC__ They actually had a competition where they selected a fan made video to be used as an official one."
"__MUSIC__ That's really cool. How long have you been a fan of Ayreon?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been a fan for years. I actually own most of their albums and some are even signed by Arjen Anthony Luccasen."
"__MUSIC__ Who is Arjen?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a singer, musician and a record producer who is the creator of Ayreon. He puts it all together."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so he isn't a singer in the band?"
"__MUSIC__ No, he is the one who selects the singers and pretty much designs albums in their entirety. They are more of a project than a steady band."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever been to one of their concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ No. Actually they usually don't hold concerts due to difficulties of having all the performers in one spot, but they will have a concert in Netherlands this autumn."
"__MUSIC__ Did you get the tickets?"
"__MUSIC__ Unfortunately they were all sold out very quickly so I didn't get the chance to buy one."
"__MUSIC__ That's a shame. Hopefully you'll get another chance in the future."
