"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, what you think about the Bears this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh gosh, talk about a re building year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I don't think they'll be that bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know man, trading for Trubisky might be one of those trades that haunts a team for a long time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I don't know, he might be really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but they already signed Mike Glennon in the off-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wasn't he just hired to take the lead dog role while Trubisky got ready?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibly, but they sure signed him to fat deal to just be a book mark."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did they give away to get Trubisky anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bro, all they moved up was one spot, and they gave away I think three or four more draft picks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ooh, yeah I didn't know that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, so now you've got a developing quarterback, with no help on the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and that's a big deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, quarterbacks don't get better when they scrambling for their life because no one is open."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, or the line sucks because you've ignored it all in the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, which is the mistake I think the Bears made."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Boy the Niners sure did well in the draft huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah for being a brand new gm, John Lynch did alright."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least with that deal anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well yeah, you never really know how good a draft is until years later anyway."
