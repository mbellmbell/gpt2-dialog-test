"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie yet?"
"__DISNEY__ No! Don't spoil it for me!"
"__DISNEY__ I won't, but Johnny Depp was so good as Captain Jack."
"__DISNEY__ I'm sure he was! I'm sad it's the last movie in the series."
"__DISNEY__ I know, I really like those movies."
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen a longer running movie series by Disney in a long time."
"__DISNEY__ What about Star Wars?"
"__DISNEY__ That doesn't count. That recently became Disney and they made all those movies before that."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. Well maybe they will find something else to continue."
"__DISNEY__ Well some movies you can only go so far without ruining it completely, so we will see."
