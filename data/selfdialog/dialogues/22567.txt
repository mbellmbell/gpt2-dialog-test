"__DISNEY__ BFG is such a weird name for a Disney movie, don't you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the Big Friendly Giant is a little weird, too, but I like him."
"__DISNEY__ He seems scary at first, but when you see him with the other giants, you realize that he's really kind of weak and scared."
"__DISNEY__ I'm glad he figured out how to defeat those other giants; they were bullies."
"__DISNEY__ I think it's hard to figure out who the real hero is in the movie: Sophie or BFG."
"__DISNEY__ I think they are both heroes because Sophie comes up with the plan, but BFG has to be brave enough to do it."
"__DISNEY__ I love the Queen character; at first she's kind of serious, but then she brings Sophie and BFG into the castle for breakfast."
"__DISNEY__ The poor servants that had to serve BFG; I felt sorry for them."
"__DISNEY__ What about the part of the breakfast when everyone drank the frobscottle?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that was the funniest and most disgusting part of the movie!  I laughed until I cried."
