"__BEATLES__ What did you think of The Beatle's 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' and the songs on that album?"
"__BEATLES__ I loved 'I'm Fixing a Hole'...I find that it really used to echo something that I felt in my life."
"__BEATLES__ Why do you say that?"
"__BEATLES__ I actually grew up in an old farmhouse. In my room, there was a spot on the ceiling caused by a leak, and I always wanted to fix it."
"__BEATLES__ But the song was metaphorical. It was supposed to be about regrets, or something like that."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I felt like the leak was in some way my fault, having to do with my life, and things I had done and hadn't done."
"__BEATLES__ And you identify with the song because of that?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I did. A lot of it also had to do with the arrangement of the song - you know, the sing-song like quality of it."
"__BEATLES__ I'm not sure that I do...can you elaborate?"
"__BEATLES__ Well, the first part sounds like a person who is singing only to themselves. After that, it blossoms."
