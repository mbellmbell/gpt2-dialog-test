"__MOVIES__ Man, I'm bored with these movies."
"__MOVIES__ What's up?"
"__MOVIES__ I wanna watch a good, scary movie. What's good lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there was The Bye Bye man. I liked that one."
"__MOVIES__ What was that about? Was it scary?"
"__MOVIES__ It was kinda scary. It was about this curse that comes when you say this guy's name."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds all right, but, gimme some more."
"__MOVIES__ All right, how about Annabelle: Creation?"
"__MOVIES__ That name sounds kinda scary already, Go on."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's in the Conjuring series. It's the fourth one, I think."
"__MOVIES__ I liked those movies. Let's go see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Easy now, friend. It's not gonna be out until August 2017, so we've got some waiting to do."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so you were just teasing me. Not cool."
"__MOVIES__ No worries, there's other movies out in the meantime."
"__MOVIES__ All right, like what though?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, there is Saw 8, if you're into that."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't they rename that one to Jigsaw?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, you're right, they did. Plus, it's not coming out until October 2017."
"__MOVIES__ Then I guess for now it's back to watching re-runs of Halloween."
"__MOVIES__ I'm up for that. Pass the pizza."
