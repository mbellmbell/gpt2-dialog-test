"__MUSIC__ Hey I heard a new Chris Janson song on the Bobby Bones show the other morning."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?  What was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was called Fix Me a Drink and I loved it!"
"__MUSIC__ That's funny, I only know of one other song by him."
"__MUSIC__ Which one?"
"__MUSIC__ Buy Me a Boat.  Seems like all his songs are directions to do something for him."
"__MUSIC__ That is funny, but seriously he makes great music!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do like the Buy Me a Boat song.  It's funny and has a good video."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I actually heard one he wrote that was about his baby daughter.  It was really sweet."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really?  That seems out of place compared to his other music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was surprising but really good."
"__MUSIC__ I bet.  I think songs about artists' children are always sweet."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like that one 'I've Been Watching You'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that's a real tear-jerker."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I tear up when I hear it too."
"__MUSIC__ Well Chris Janson is coming out with some great new songs, I can't wait to see what he comes up with next."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's definitely on my radar."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too."
"__MUSIC__ Well check out that new Fix Me a Drink song and let me know what you think"
"__MUSIC__ I definitely will!"
