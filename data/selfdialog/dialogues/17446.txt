"__MOVIES__ In my opinion, one of the better movies over the last decade is The Wrestler. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen it, but I do recall hearing very good things about it. I know it's about professional wrestling, but what is the concept?"
"__MOVIES__ Essentially, an aging wrestler still holding on to his glory, suffers a heart attack forcing him into retirement."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds quite dramatic. Any other good details about the film?"
"__MOVIES__ The wrestler's name is Randy 'The Ram' Robinson played by Mickey Rourke and we get to know him even better after his heart attack."
"__MOVIES__ Despite me not being the biggest fan of wrestling, it sounds like it could be decent."
"__MOVIES__ Oh it is an excellent movie. I know people who are not fans at all of wrestling but really enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ I heard Mickey Rourke actually won an Oscar for his performance?"
"__MOVIES__ I want to say he did, but I am not 100% sure. I definitely think he earned some type of award for it, though."
"__MOVIES__ What aspects of his personal life does the movie go into?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, times are tough for Randy, for he is older, and still wrestling on the Independence side of things. He works at a local grocery store for a pretty rude boss."
"__MOVIES__ What happens to him after his heart attack?"
"__MOVIES__ After he suffers a heart attack and is forced into retirement, he tries to better his life, especially his fallen relationship with his daughter."
"__MOVIES__ The Wrestler sounds like very a inner and personal movie. How does it go for him?"
"__MOVIES__ I do not want to spoil much of anything, but a lot of his it just a man who has nothing in his life but wrestling. You quickly learn how behind on the times he is once we get to know Randy."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think The Wrestler is based off any one real life professional in particular?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say, Jake Robert, and I've heard that is the speculation. If you read up on his personal life, they are quite similar."
"__MOVIES__ Does he end up wrestling again?"
"__MOVIES__ I will give you that spoiler and say yes, he does. Despite doctors orders, towards the end, he agrees to get back in the ring."
"__MOVIES__ That is all I need to know and I am definitely interested in this one!"
