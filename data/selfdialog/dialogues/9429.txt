"__BASEBALL__ yes, but who has the most homeruns in a single season and how many?"
"__BASEBALL__ Easy again. Barry Bonds. 73. the year of our good lord, 2001."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok. I'm going to stump you sooner or later. Let's see. Most strikeouts in his career?"
"__BASEBALL__ That's even easier than the homerun count. Nolan Ryan with 5714. The Second is Randy Johnson, but 839 less than Ryan"
"__BASEBALL__ Most strikeouts in a single season."
"__BASEBALL__ This is actually pretty interesting. It's Matt Kilroy, but from the year 1886, in the 20th century, again, Nolan Ryan with 383 in 1973"
"__BASEBALL__ Who stole the most bases?"
"__BASEBALL__ Rickey Henderson 1406."
"__BASEBALL__ Who stole the most bases in a single season?"
"__BASEBALL__ Rickety Henderson again with 130 stolen bases in the 1982 season. But that's limiting ourselves to the 20th century. Hugh Nicol had 138 in 1887."
"__BASEBALL__ Ok, then who stole the most home base? Over the entire career"
"__BASEBALL__ Stealing home isn't common, so this number is pretty small. And it's not kept as a record separately from the other steals."
"__BASEBALL__ You've been stumped"
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe."
"__BASEBALL__ Admit it."
"__BASEBALL__ No. Ty Cobb has 54 home steals. But it's not an official stat from the MLB. it's not that I don't know, but rather it's not kept a record of."
