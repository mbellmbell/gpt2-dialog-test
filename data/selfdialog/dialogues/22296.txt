"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie from your childhood?"
"__DISNEY__ I would have to say The Fox and The Hound."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I loved that movie too! Todd the fox was so cute!"
"__DISNEY__ He was. It was actually a really emotional movie for me, and still is!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, I love watching Disney movies from my childhood now that I'm an adult. I catch all sorts of things I missed when I was a kid."
"__DISNEY__ I know! It's like watching the movie for the first time again."
"__DISNEY__ The part where Todd and Copper rescue the old dog gets me every time."
"__DISNEY__ That movie does teach kids a lot about compassion."
"__DISNEY__ It does. I feel like a lot of Disney movies have great teaching tools like that."
"__DISNEY__ They really do. I'm glad we grew up with them!"
