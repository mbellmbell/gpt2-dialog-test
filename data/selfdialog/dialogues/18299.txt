"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you see this movie about contacting or speaking with aliens? It's quite new."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean 'Arrival'?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it a couple of months ago. Great movie."
"__MOVIES__ It was so cool! I loved the new perspective they gave to aliens visiting Earth."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was very well thought of."
"__MOVIES__ And the cast was great too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, this Amy Adams girl keeps killing it in every movie she is in."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, right? And what about the guy who is also on the latest 'Mission Impossible' movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Jeremy Renner I believe is his name. He is also great."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I loved how they got along on screen."
"__MOVIES__ Man, but isin't it strange to you that in alien movies, humans always try to kill them..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that is one of the things I liked about this one. That it shows how maybe if aliens come to Earth it would be to help us."
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. I also liked that approach."
"__MOVIES__ And the whole movie was quite intelligent. I liked the reasoning of all the aspects of it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it also made me think a lot."
"__MOVIES__ It was suprisingly good, since every time I go see an alien movie I expect more of the same."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely this one brought something new to the table."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it should have won 'Best Picture' at the 'Oscars'."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't know if I would go that far..."
