"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is your favorite NFL team these days?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I love my Cincinnati Bengals!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, that makes me feel sorry for you!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever, I think we have a very bright future ahead of us!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not until management finally decides to fire Marvin Lewis you don't."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not think that is fair, he has gotten us to the playoffs year after year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That s true, however, he is 0-7 when he gets to the playoffs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Trust me, I know all about his lack of playoff success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like getting to the playoffs is a nice accomplishment; but at some point you have to win a couple, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I just feel like at some point he will break through and make a nice run."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he has had very talented teams over the years and still come up empty in the playoff win column."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like some of the blame has to fall on the quarterback position as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am not sure about that, Andy Dalton is actually pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is, but I feel like he could be more consistent throughout the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He played his college football at TCU and even won a Rose Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does that have to do with anything?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It just shows that he can lead a winning program to great post season success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get what you are saying, hopefully he can rack up some playoff wins before his career is over."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he has got one of the best receivers in the game to help him along."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true! I think we will be be much better in the future."
