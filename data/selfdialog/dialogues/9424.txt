"__BASEBALL__ So what do you think about the Detroit Tigers?"
"__BASEBALL__ Overrated. I don't see them going anywhere this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Are you kidding me? With the bats they have?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are only at .500! Can't be that great..."
"__BASEBALL__ They did have a few injuries."
"__BASEBALL__ Doesn't explain everything. Besides their piching stinks."
"__BASEBALL__ It isn't that bad. They have three aces that are pretty good."
"__BASEBALL__ Again, being .500 in May isn't a good sign. They aren't exactly overpowering."
"__BASEBALL__ They're in a tough division. They'll come around"
"__BASEBALL__ Not with Cleveland in that division."
"__BASEBALL__ Tigers have dominated Cleveland this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Luck only. They aren't nearly as talented."
"__BASEBALL__ With Miggy and J.D. Martinez? They're superstars!"
"__BASEBALL__ They still have no pitching. The bullpen is horrible."
"__BASEBALL__ Pitching is always streaky no matter which team you're talking about."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't see this group getting any better."
"__BASEBALL__ They'll come around. Verlander is still on top of his game. Plus he has Kate Upton to help him at home."
"__BASEBALL__ I'll give you that. Won't help the team much though."
"__BASEBALL__ I still say they will win the division."
"__BASEBALL__ I wouldn't bet on it."
