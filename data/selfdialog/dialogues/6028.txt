"__STAR_WARS__ What are your thoughts on Star Wars rogue 1?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked it a lot! I was surprised at how much I actually like do it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know what you mean, the characters were spot on."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, and it’s amazing how well the new Star Wars movies are true to the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ That’s why I was so happy when Disney bought the franchise, I was also a little concerned but now I see that they are doing incredible things."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes and as a spin off doing well, I bet they’ll make more spin offs!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard they are working on another spin off, a Han Solo movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes there are, and I’m already excited to see what they will do with the Han Solo character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel that it’s almost guaranteed to be good, if what they have done so far is anything to go by."
"__STAR_WARS__ And don’t forget we’ve got the last Jedi to look forward to also."
