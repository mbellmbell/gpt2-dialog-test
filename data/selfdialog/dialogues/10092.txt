"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ain't nothin' but a G thang baby........."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What are you doing? You quoting Dr. Dre?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Actually, I am quoting Snoop Dogg or Snoop Lion or whatever he calls himself today."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why'd he change his name anyway? Snoop Dogg sounds so much better than Snoop Lion."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Beats me. All I know is The Chronic album was the bomb."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You darn right. It was definitely my favorite rap album back in the day."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And the videos were so raunchy. I don't think MTV would play them anymore."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Does MTV still play music videos? I honestly do not know."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Was the dude that played Eazy E in the Snoop and Dre videos the same little dude that was in Ice Cube's Friday movie?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a really good question. I don't know but they do look just alike."
