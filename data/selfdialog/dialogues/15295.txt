"__HARRY_POTTER__ I have to admit, I had mixed feelings on some of the casting for the Harry Potter movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You don't like Daniel Radcliffe?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh no, he's great! I also thought that Ron and Hermione were perfectly cast."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Dumbledore, too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, for sure! The ones I struggled were some of the minor characters, especially Lily."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You didn't like her?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh no, it's not that I disliked her. I just didn't think they chose the right actress for the part."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why do you say that?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She and Harry were supposed to have the same eyes and she died really young. The actress who played her was much older and her eyes were nothing like Daniel Radcliffe's."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I can see that."
