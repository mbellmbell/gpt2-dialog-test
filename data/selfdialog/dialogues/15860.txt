"__ROCK__ Hey man, what kind of sub-genres of rock music do you like?"
"__ROCK__ Well, I personally listen to mostly indie rock. I'm not too fond of mainstream bands."
"__ROCK__ Dude, you sound like such a hipster! What about Aerosmith, and AC/DC?"
"__ROCK__ I appreciate them for what they've done for the genre as a whole, but they're not really my cup of tea."
"__ROCK__ That's blasphemy man! How can you not like classic bands like that?"
"__ROCK__ Well, I feel like their stuff is too played out. The lyrics and songwriting just don't vibe well with me."
"__ROCK__ So, you're into softer, more mellow stuff? In my opinion, you're either headbanging, or you're doing it wrong."
"__ROCK__ That's like, your opinion man. I'm entitled to like whatever bands I want to like."
"__ROCK__ You have a point there man, but at least give me some recommendations for indie rock bands."
"__ROCK__ Check out Fleet Foxes dude, their album Helplessness Blues is one of my all-time favorites."
