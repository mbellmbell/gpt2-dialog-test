"__MUSIC__ What is a song that you really like, but you think is too long?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd have to say anything by Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, they did write some long songs. But is there any one that sticks out in your mind?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say 'Dogs' from their 'Animals' album."
"__MUSIC__ I actually really like that song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I do too. But it's just too long."
"__MUSIC__ I see, I can understand that."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe it's the fact that I'm more lyrics oriented."
"__MUSIC__ If that's the case, then some of those interludes between lyrics must bother you."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. It's always been that way for me with music."
"__MUSIC__ For me, the lyrics usually don't matter much."
"__MUSIC__ I can't identify with that - the lyrics are what the song is about!"
"__MUSIC__ Not necessarily. Sometimes the music speaks for itself moreso than the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Not to me!"
"__MUSIC__ Well, then you're missing out on some beautiful and meaningful music."
"__MUSIC__ Fortunately, there's enough music out there for both people like me and people like you."
"__MUSIC__ True. Although I'm not saying I don't like lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ You're just more diverse in your musical appreciation than me, is what I'm seeing."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't say it like that."
"__MUSIC__ No, I think it's probably true, and it's OK. As long as there's stuff I like, I'm fine with some people having a wider range of enjoyment."
