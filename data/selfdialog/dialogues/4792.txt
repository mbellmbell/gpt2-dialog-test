"__MUSIC__ What do you think about the band KISS?"
"__MUSIC__ They're not bad.  They've been around for a while, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah.  Since the early-1970s."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool.  I don't know a lot of their songs, but Rock n' Roll All Night is pretty good."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know any others?"
"__MUSIC__ Just Beth, Strutter, and Shout It Out Loud."
"__MUSIC__ I love Shout It Out Loud!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  It's probably my favorite.  What are you favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Love Gun, Detroit Rock City, God of Thunder, and Calling Dr. Love."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah!  I really like those too.  What others?"
"__MUSIC__ Lick It Up, Beth, Black Diamond, and Psycho Circus."
"__MUSIC__ Oh cool.  Psycho Circus is pretty great too."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I could listen to that on repeat."
"__MUSIC__ What about their make-up though?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think that's what appealed to me the most when I first started listening to them.  That, and their movies."
"__MUSIC__ What movies?"
"__MUSIC__ KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park and Detroit Rock City!  You've never seen them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, are they good?"
"__MUSIC__ The Phantom is okay, but Detroit Rock City is one of my favorite movies!  You should watch it!"
"__MUSIC__ I will.  Thanks!"
