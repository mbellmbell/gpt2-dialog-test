"__THRILLER__ I like thrillers that have a political angle. Things like All The President's Men or Blow Out. Some older ones, but still good."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, political can be good. Even something like WarGames, the old one with Matthew Broderick, could be considered political."
"__THRILLER__ Oh sure. After all, it was about nuclear war. That's pretty political."
"__THRILLER__ I also really like thriller movies that are reality-based. Stuff like Erin Brockovich starring Julia Roberts, which was based on a true story."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, she was so good in that. Good example of a movie that could have been boring but was actually great."
"__THRILLER__ Very true. Oh, another good example of an old one that still stands up: The China Syndrome."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, that was from the seventies, wasn't it? That movie scared the heck out of me."
"__THRILLER__ Yet, 1979, I think. Scared me, too."
"__THRILLER__ Did you ever see The Fugitive? That's a thriller, isn't it?"
"__THRILLER__ I think so. An action thriller, at least."
