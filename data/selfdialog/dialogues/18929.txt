"__MOVIES__ You know what the best romantic subplot in all the Avenger movies is?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what?"
"__MOVIES__ It's Steve and Peggy."
"__MOVIES__ Steve and Peggy? Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. He can never bring himself to tell her how he feels until it's too late, and his plane is going down and everybody thinks he's going to die, and they talk about having never had that dance together."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that will get you in the feels every time."
"__MOVIES__ Then after he wakes up, he tracks her down at the hospital, and she's an elderly woman and he hasn't aged."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it's almost like it doesn't even matter to him."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! He just wants to see her, no matter how old she is."
"__MOVIES__ And then he gets her the glass of water, and when he turned around it's as if she sees him for the first time..."
"__MOVIES__ That will really kick you in the feels. She's so over-whelmed to see him alive."
"__MOVIES__ And it's almost like she doesn't understand how impossibly long it's been. She's just overwhelmed at seeing him again..."
"__MOVIES__ After she thought she had lost him forever."
"__MOVIES__ And Cap tears up a little. He knows she's stuck in this hellish condition where she can't remember things clearly..."
"__MOVIES__ ...and every time she seems him, it will be like she's just realizing he's still alive..."
"__MOVIES__ ...and every time, she experiences the heartache and sadness all over again."
"__MOVIES__ And as much as he wants to see her, he knows it's best if he doesn't. He doesn't want to keep putting her through that."
"__MOVIES__ And so he walks away."
"__MOVIES__ But he never gets over her. Never."
"__MOVIES__ Man, I was sure you were going to say that Natasha and the Hulk was the best romance in the Avengers."
