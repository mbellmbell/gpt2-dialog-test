"__MOVIES__ So do you like movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure do!  Do you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Do you prefer to see them in the theater or at home?"
"__MOVIES__ I like to see movies in the theater about once a week and at home the rest of the time.....what about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I used to like theaters but they are so expensive!"
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean."
"__MOVIES__ What have you seen lately?"
"__MOVIES__ The Shack was great.  I read the book and bought the DVD"
"__MOVIES__ I bought that one too"
"__MOVIES__ I think you like to see them mostly at home"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, well, that's pretty much true.  That way I don't have to get tempted by the theater's buttered popcorn"
"__MOVIES__ what are some of  your favorite types?"
"__MOVIES__ Another reason I prefer to watch at home...my absolute favorite is documentary. and they don't show those in theaters much"
"__MOVIES__ i love those too, but i really love action movies most"
"__MOVIES__ then you must be pleased with the current batch of movies"
"__MOVIES__ yep.  but a good drama can also foot the bill. i guess i like shoot-em-ups most of all..."
"__MOVIES__ so  no rom-com for you?"
"__MOVIES__ not if i can help it."
"__MOVIES__ I am not much of a rom-com fan myself..."
"__MOVIES__ i can't believe it!"
