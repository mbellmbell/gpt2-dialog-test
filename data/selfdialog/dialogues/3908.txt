"__MUSIC__ I'm trying to make the perfect party playlist."
"__MUSIC__ What's on it so far!"
"__MUSIC__ Lots of things. It's a pretty busy playlist. I want to make sure it can appeal to everyone."
"__MUSIC__ Give me some examples."
"__MUSIC__ Well, of course, Party in the USA. People will scoff, but everyone will always dance to it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm a little skeptical, but okay."
"__MUSIC__ And then Will Smith's Wild Wild West."
"__MUSIC__ I don't even remember that."
"__MUSIC__ Trust me, it's great. How could you forget Will Smith's musical career?"
"__MUSIC__ I just don't think that's what people remember Will Smith for."
"__MUSIC__ Well they should. He's incredible."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, okay. What else is on it."
"__MUSIC__ Both the real and Weird Al versions of Gangster's Paradise."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, those are good. You know I saw Weird Al at a County Faire once?"
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. He kept running off stage to change costumes and played clips of his guest appearances on TV shows."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a good time."
"__MUSIC__ It really was."
"__MUSIC__ I might need to add another Weird Al song then."
"__MUSIC__ I think you should."
