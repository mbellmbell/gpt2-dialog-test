"__BASEBALL__ Who will win the American League East this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yankees or Red Sox like usual."
"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees play well at home, but who knows how it'll play out over the course of a season."
"__BASEBALL__ Baltimore isn't terrible either. Don't know if the pitching is up to par."
"__BASEBALL__ That's why I don't discount the Red Sox, they have quality starting pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ True. And the SP available at the trade deadline this season looks pretty underwhelming."
"__BASEBALL__ What happened to Toronto? They are under-performing."
"__BASEBALL__ They're a little banged up so they got out of the starting block slow."
"__BASEBALL__ If they can turn it around and have Stroman carry the rotation they could be back in it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they could easily slide back and have an uphill climb just to play catch up."
"__BASEBALL__ I hate to say it, but the Yankees made really good moves-not just throwing money around."
"__BASEBALL__ They did get younger really quick. Their prospects like Bird, Judge, and Sanchez have really flourished."
"__BASEBALL__ It's not murderer's row, but you're right. They traded Chapman then re-signed him, now they have the prospects and Chapman back"
"__BASEBALL__ They built a lot of those deals with the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ The Chapman deal plus the Castro one, too. Cubs spreading the wealth."
"__BASEBALL__ Who has a better young core? The Yankees or Red Sox?"
"__BASEBALL__ Tough to say, but Bogaerts, Betts, Benitendi are a solid counter."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I think that group with Sale throwing is trouble for everyone else."
"__BASEBALL__ They'll be battling for years to come carrying on the rivalry."
"__BASEBALL__ Absolutely. It never ends."
