"__MOVIES__ Have you seen anything interesting lately?"

"__MOVIES__ What was it called?"
"__MOVIES__ The Black Cauldron; have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I've heard of it but didn't see it as a kid. Was it good?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think it was great to be honest."
"__MOVIES__ What didn't you like about it?"

"__MOVIES__ Was there anyone in it that I would know?"
"__MOVIES__ John Hurt was the voice of the villain."
"__MOVIES__ Was the movie received well when it came out?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it was considered a major failure for Disney."
