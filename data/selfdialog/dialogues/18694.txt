"__MOVIES__ Did you see the movie Why Him?"
"__MOVIES__ The one with James Franco?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it has James Franco and Bryan Cranston."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I saw it. It was really funny I was honestly surprised how funny it was."
"__MOVIES__ I know me too. I wasn't even going to see it because it looked corny but my brother told me how good it was."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I really like seeing Bryan Cranston doing a variety of rolls. He was so serious in Breaking Bad but so funny in this."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree. Breaking Bad was amazing and he did such a great job, but I love seeing him doing funny roles as well."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I am a huge comedy lover so I tend to watch a lot of comedy movies."
"__MOVIES__ Same here. Did you watch Get A Job? Bryan Cranston has a roll in that movie too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I love that movie. Anna Kendrick and Miles Teller were great together and Bryan Cranston played a believable father role."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was nice to see a movie where people were dealing with life struggles that were so realateable."
"__MOVIES__ Relateable and also so funny. I feel like it went unnoticed too when it came out."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. It was almost like an indie movie but there was so much there. One of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ It was so funny how Bryan Cranston started going to the coffee shop and that barista started helping him with social media."
"__MOVIES__ I know I loved her! And I loved how he was just going there everyday and then really started to like it."
"__MOVIES__ I know, see that is why I love him. He is lovable and agreeable in almost everything he plays."
"__MOVIES__ I know! Even in Breaking Bad I also loved him. Like you wanted to root for the bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ I completely agree. Man now I really want to go re-watch Get A Job."
"__MOVIES__ Well I actually have it on DVD so if you want to come over we can watch it together."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good. I'll see if I have any other comedies of Bryan Cranston films too."
