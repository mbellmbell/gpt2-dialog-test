"__THRILLER__ Have you seen that thriller movie 'Ghost in the Shell' with Scarlett Johansson?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I saw it last month. I was surprised that I liked it."
"__THRILLER__ Why, what did you expect going in?"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I thought it might just be mindless action, something short on plot and just loud."
"__THRILLER__ So, did it have a good plot? Isn't it a remake of a Japanese movie?"
"__THRILLER__ It's based on a Japanese manga, a comic of the same name. And the plot gave me something to think about later."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I like that kind of plot. Makes me want to see the movie again."
"__THRILLER__ I would see it again so that I can pay more attention to the detailed sets and the little things now that I know what's going to happen."
"__THRILLER__ Were there any other big name stars? Names I might recognize?"
"__THRILLER__ You'd recognize the French actress Juliette Binoche. We saw her play Bryan Cranston's wife in the Godzilla movie that came out in 2014."
