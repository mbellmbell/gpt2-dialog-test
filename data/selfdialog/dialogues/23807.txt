"__SUPERHERO__ What super hero movie should I watch?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Have you seen Antman yet?"
"__SUPERHERO__ No, I haven't gotten around to it. Is it good?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Very good. It was hard to picture Paul Rudd as a superhero, but he actually is really great."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, he seems like such a normal guy, I can't picture him as being tough."
"__SUPERHERO__ He really worked hard to get the role, he wanted to be believable."
"__SUPERHERO__ I have seen him in some interviews and he definitely bulked up."
"__SUPERHERO__ You're not kidding. He got so big they had to alter his costume."
"__SUPERHERO__ No way!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, his muscles were so big, they had to alter the suit so he could fit!"
