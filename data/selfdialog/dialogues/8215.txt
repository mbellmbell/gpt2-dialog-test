"__POP__ what do you think of miley cyrus"
"__POP__ i only know wrecking ball"
"__POP__ do you like wrecking ball"
"__POP__ no, it was stupid"
"__POP__ how is it stupid?"
"__POP__ who wants a song about a wrecking ball"
"__POP__ its a metaphor. ever heard of it?"
"__POP__ well, its about a relationship, right?"
"__POP__ yeah, he came in like a wrecking ball"
"__POP__ thats in the lyrics!"
