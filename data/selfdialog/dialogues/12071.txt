"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does the Jets schedule look like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty tough, I think, and their division is difficult."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do they have any prime time games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, every team must have one.      They play Buffalo in November on a Thursday"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will the Jets running game hold up?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It absolutely must, since the passing game is in such doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who will be the leaders carrying the ball?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ First is Matt Forte at running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How did he do last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A touch over 800 yards, so not great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK, who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also have Bilal Powell. with 700 yards last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Less than 2000 yards between the top two running backs is tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, definitely not Pro Bowl numbers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the staff?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Jets have a new offensive coordinator."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Will that help?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ John Morton is going to want to increase the tempo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With no quarterback and a limited running game, can that work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The magic eight ball would definitely be evasive about the status!"
