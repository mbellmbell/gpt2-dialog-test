"__STAR_WARS__ Hey you like Star Wars, right? Who is your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean overall? It's so hard to choose, but I really like Leia"
"__STAR_WARS__ Leia is an awesome character, no doubt. I wonder how they'll handle her character now that Carrie Fisher has passed away."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm still really bummed about that, but I'm sure they'll figure something out for Leia in The Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Speaking of which, do you think Luke is going to turn to the dark side?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I think they're just trying to mislead people with that. But I'm still really looking forward to episode VIII."
"__STAR_WARS__ Can you believe they're making an entirely new trilogy after the prequel movies were so controversial?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The prequels weren't that bad. Too much CGI, yes, but the stories and characters were solid"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. And I really hope Sam Jackson is right about Mace Windu still being alive!"
"__STAR_WARS__ And if he did survive, then maybe his kids will show up in one of the new movies! Maybe Finn is his grandson or something, too."
