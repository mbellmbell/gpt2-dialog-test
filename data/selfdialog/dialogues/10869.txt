"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which of the incoming rookie quarterbacks do you think will have the best season in 2017?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say Patrick Mahomes, but I'm not too optimistic about him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is not a great rookie quarterback class. I'm still surprised you chose Mahomes though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't necessarily believe that he has the highest ceiling of this rookie class, but I think that having Andy Reid has his head coach positions him well for success."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Andy Reid a lot, but Mahomes never ran a pro-style offense at Texas Tech. Why do you think he'll be able to pick it up quickly in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The good thing for Mahomes is that he doesn't need to pick it up too quickly because the Chiefs have a reliable veteran in Alex Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fair point, we'll see who's right once we're in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, who do you have as your top rookie quarterback going into the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know that this is unusual, but I think that DeShone Kizer has the most potential of anyone from this rookie class."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you serious? The rookie quarterback for the dumpster fire that is the Cleveland Browns?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hear me out. He has size, arm strength, and an offensive-minded head coach in Hue Jackson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he plays for the worst football team in the NFL in a very tough division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally agree that Cleveland isn't a model franchise, but Kizer will be stepping into an offense with a decent running game and a good offensive line. Give him a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think Cleveland has held on to the same quarterback for more than two seasons since they got their NFL franchise back in 1999. I wouldn't hold my breath."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's only Hue Jackson's second year. Again, please give him a chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their 1-15 record from last year is more than enough evidence for me to make up my mind about Hue Jackson as a head coach. In fact, I would say that DeShone Kizer is in a worse situation football-wise compared with Mitch Trubisky."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree that Mitch Trubisky is a pretty bad situation in Chicago, but at least he has a veteran quarterback in Mike Glennon that he can develop behind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chicago Bears are an organizational mess that over traded to move up to second in the Draft to take Trubisky. I am worried for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish I could disagree with you more, but with the loss of Alshon Jeffery in free agency, I don't see him having any offensive weapons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and the issues are only compounded by their defensive-minded head coach John Fox."
