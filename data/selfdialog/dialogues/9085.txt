"__BASEBALL__ The Yankees are doing well this season, don't you think?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, for sure. They have one of the best records in the MLB."
"__BASEBALL__ How'd they get so good again all of a sudden?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, they have a strong roster. Especially those young guys, Gary Sanchez and Aaron Judge."
"__BASEBALL__ Can you believe Judge already has 13 home runs?"
"__BASEBALL__ I guess being 6'7' gives a guy some real power."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Yankees, Cubs game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ Some of it, I couldn't stay up for all 18 innings."
"__BASEBALL__ Neither could I. It's like a double header in one game."
"__BASEBALL__ Speaking of the Cubs, do you think they have a chance to repeat this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, maybe, but they sure aren't getting off to a start like they did last season."
"__BASEBALL__ True, and they did just get swept by the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ They're only one game above 500 right now, so not so promising a start."
"__BASEBALL__ They have time to figure it out though. It's a long season."
"__BASEBALL__ True, but even if they do, I bet they'll have a tough time getting past the Nationals."
"__BASEBALL__ Bryce Harper could be MVP this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and they have Murphy batting right behind him."
"__BASEBALL__ Can't forget the pitching, the Nationals may have the best rotation in the league."
"__BASEBALL__ Of course you never know who might go down from injury."
"__BASEBALL__ True, it's such a long season, can't count on all the guys being there at the end."
