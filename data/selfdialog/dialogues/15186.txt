"__HARRY_POTTER__ Who is your least favorite character in the Harry Potter series?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really don't like Peter Pettigrew. He betrayed the Potters and ultimately helped Voldemort come back to power."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, and then he was so close to Harry throughout most of his time at Hogwarts but Harry didn't even know."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wait, what do you mean he was close to Harry?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Peter Pettigrew was Ron's rat, Scabbers! He was an Animagus."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, you're right! Now I remember. Whenever they would look at the Maurader's Map, they'd see Ron sleeping next to someone named Wormtail and be confused."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Who do you think your favorite character is?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love both of the Weasley twins. I can't handle at the end of the last movie when Fred dies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. I thought that was one of the saddest parts of the entire series."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So many people died at the Battle of Hogwarts. There's one shot of Colin Creevy, that little boy who always had a camera, and that always makes me sad."
