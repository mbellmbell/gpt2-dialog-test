"__DISNEY__ You're about 25 years old right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep, 26 actually."
"__DISNEY__ Nice, so you got to grow up in the wonderful world of classic, hand-drawn Disney films."
"__DISNEY__ I did! All the classics. I must have watched The Lion King at least 100 times as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ The Lion King is hands down one of the best Disney films of all time."
"__DISNEY__ Oh for sure. There probably isn't a person my age out there that hasn't seen The Lion King at least once."
"__DISNEY__ Yea you're probably right. Even with how graphic the scenes with Mufasa and Simba's dad were, it was a great movie for kids."
"__DISNEY__ Yea that scene was heartbreaking. It made the film feel real though."
"__DISNEY__ It made it step away from the classic formula of the good guys always winning and everyone having a happy ending."
"__DISNEY__ Which in turn is probably why it became such an intant classic."
