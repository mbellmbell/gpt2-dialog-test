"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That's a hard decision. Probably, Ghostbusters."
"__MOVIES__ The new Ghostbusters from a few months ago?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the original one form the 1980s with Bill Murray. It is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it. Who else is in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It has lots of people. Annie Potts, Sigourney Weaver, Dan Akroyd, and Ernie Hudson to name a few."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that sounds like a who's who of 80's stars. Is it all comedy or is it scary, too?"
"__MOVIES__ It's pretty much a farce, but it's amazing. I have seen it over 20 times. I can quote most of it."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I don't think I have seen any movie 20 times. I saw the latest Star Wars 5 times, though."
"__MOVIES__ You mean Rouge One?"
"__MOVIES__ No, the last one with a new trilogy. The Force Awakens."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that one twice. It made me feel like a child again. It was like watching the first trilogy."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe that's why you like Ghostbuster's so much."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean like nostalgia from your childhood."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, but I don't think so. Ghostbuster's just makes me laugh."
"__MOVIES__ Even after seeing it 20 times."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. The delivery is so perfect it still sounds like the jokes are made up on the spot. I am telling you it is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I will stream it this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ You should, I think you would really enjoy it."
