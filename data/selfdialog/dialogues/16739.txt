"__MOVIES__ Have you seen The Conjuring 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw it in the theater when it was first released."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of it? Did you enjoy the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, in a way, but the way they tried to make it over the top kind of ruined it for me."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I've done reading on the true story that inspired the movie, and to be honest, it was more scary than the film."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the movie was terrifying!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it had it's creepy moments, but for me, it takes away from the effect when they don't stay as close to the truth as possible."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, so what in the movie wasn't true?"
"__MOVIES__ For one thing, there's no such thing as a Valak."
"__MOVIES__ A Valak? Oh, you mean that demon dressed as a nun."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, exactly, they just added that in. And I guess the doll, Annabelle, had nothing to do with the original story."
"__MOVIES__ I guess they needed to link The Conjuring films to the Annabelle films."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, exactly. But why add an entirely new demon that doesn't even exist then?"
"__MOVIES__ That's Hollywood for you. You need to be able to 'see' the evil."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I guess you're right. An unseen force controlling things doesn't make for an exciting movie."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're just an old cynic."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose I am!"
"__MOVIES__ All in all, I still thought it was a great film."
"__MOVIES__ Eh, I give it a 6."
