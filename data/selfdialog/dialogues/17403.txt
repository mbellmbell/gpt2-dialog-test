"__MOVIES__ Ever After is my favorite romance movie."
"__MOVIES__ What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's like a twist on Cinderella, but it's still set in the old days."
"__MOVIES__ So it's like a fairy tale?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but believe me. It is much better than it sounds."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, who is kind of like Cinderella. Anjelica Huston plays the mean stepmother."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I loved Anjelica in the Addams Family movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. She was great as Morticia."
"__MOVIES__ I like Addams Family Values more than the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ I do as well."
"__MOVIES__ It's so funny when Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to summer camp."
"__MOVIES__ Pugsley was so cute in his striped outfit."
"__MOVIES__ I know, and Christina Ricci did a great job as Wednesday."
"__MOVIES__ I always mistake Monica Keena for Christina Ricci."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I don't think they look anything alike."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe not now, but when Monica starred in Snow White: A Tale of Terror she looked just like Christina."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was so creepy."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but Sigourney Weaver did a great job in her role."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. She always blows me away."
