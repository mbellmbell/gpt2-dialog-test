"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Did you see any movies over Memorial Day weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I did catch up with that animated movie called Big Hero 6."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I never saw that. Was it any good?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have to say the world building was impressive. They created this entire futuristic city called San Fransokyo."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Where would you rank it with other similar films?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I would say it was similar to the second How to Train Your Dragon movie. Good visuals but not that great of a plot."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's interesting. I saw a pretty good movie recently called Logan."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I heard about that. That is the new X-Men movie, right?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's right. I have to say it's definitely one of the better superhero movies I've seen."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I always have trouble keeping the timelines straight with all those movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Luckily with this one it is set in the future and most of the mutants are dead, so you don't have to worry about timelines."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow, I'm surprised. It kind of sounds like a downer though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It definitely was a bit of a downer. Especially seeing the characters get old and sick."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But you still liked it?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Definitely, it was much better than the usual CGI superhero movie where you see a city get destroyed each time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Cool, I will have to check that out. Is there any new movies you want to see?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I have been hearing lots of good things about the new Wonder Woman movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah, that looks pretty good. I do like that actor with the square jaw."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ You mean Chris Pine? He was good as Captain Kirk in the Star Trek movies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one. We should go see that together."
