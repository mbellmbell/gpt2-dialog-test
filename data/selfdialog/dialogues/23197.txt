"__DISNEY__ I hope Disney has a new movie coming out soon. I'm sick of watching Moana with my little one."
"__DISNEY__ I don't know when their next film comes out but I know they just finished filming a Mary Poppins reboot."
"__DISNEY__ Who is starring in that?"
"__DISNEY__ Emily Blunt is Mary Poppins and Lin-Manuel Miranda is playing Bert"
"__DISNEY__ The guy from Hamilton? That should be great!"
"__DISNEY__ I think so too! I also read that he is going to be Sebastian the crab in the live action Little Mermaid remake."
"__DISNEY__ They must be out of ideas since they are remaking everything."
"__DISNEY__ Probably so. I know they are doing a remake of the Lion King that way too."
"__DISNEY__ That's such a classic! I don't know why they would bother remaking it."
"__DISNEY__ I guess nostalgia makes big bucks."
