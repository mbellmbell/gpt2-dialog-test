"__MUSIC__ What is your opinion of Nickleback?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they have gotten a bad rap and are a really talented group."
"__MUSIC__ I tend to agree, I have listened to them since I was young."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really understand why people act like they are so bad."
"__MUSIC__ They have basically become a meme."
"__MUSIC__ They may have a bit of pop sound and sing about some silly stuff sometimes but they are certainly very talented."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, I actually still enjoy listening to their music sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ The singer Chad Kroger basically sacrificed his vocal cords to entertain people."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I think he had a cyst on his vocal cords surgically removed."
"__MUSIC__ How does that even happen?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I remember about a decade ago a doctor said that his vocal cords would not last another seven years if he kept singing the way he does."
"__MUSIC__ Well it seems he is still singing, they just put out a new song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I gave it a listen but I wasn't a big fan of it."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, it seems like they have just run out of ideas and that special something that their music had ten years ago seems to be gone."
"__MUSIC__ Its a sad thing to see something so great kind of fade away into obscurity to the point they are just a joke now on the internet."
"__MUSIC__ Ten years ago they were on top of the billboard charts."
"__MUSIC__ I think they should focus on leaving on a high note and if they still need to make an income there are probably dozens of ways for them to do that considering their level of fame."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I think they should keep doing what they love."
"__MUSIC__ I don't disagree, I just feel like they are going downhill."
"__MUSIC__ Who knows, maybe their new album will have some decent songs."
