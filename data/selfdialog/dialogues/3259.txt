"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Flotsam and Jetsam?"
"__MUSIC__ I know those are the eels from The Little Mermaid."
"__MUSIC__ No, I'm talking about the metal band."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, then no I haven't heard of them."
"__MUSIC__ Not a lot of people now know of them I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ They were really big in the 80's."
"__MUSIC__ Were they like a hair metal band?"
"__MUSIC__ It was kind of like that, there was a lot of screaming so I guess you could say that."
"__MUSIC__ Was it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually yes, much of their early stuff is good but the mixing is kind of strange."
"__MUSIC__ How is it strange?"
"__MUSIC__ Some albums sound really piercing on the high end, and can get tiring to listen to. The music is really good though."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have any newer stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ They've got a ton of newer stuff, and have been putting a lot of albums out lately."
"__MUSIC__ What's one of the better new ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Their newest one, which is the self-titled album, is really good."
"__MUSIC__ Is it heavy heavy metal or does it sound like 80's stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Some songs are pretty heavy, but they are pretty varied. All of it is good though."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, it's nice that they're still around and productive."
