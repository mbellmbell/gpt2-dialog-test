"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know one of the actors is banned from Star Wars events?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  That seems strange and bizarre."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  Apparently, George Lucas doesn't like him and think he's annoying?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Harrison Ford?  Mark Hamill?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, it's actually the guy who played Darth Vader in the original movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I know who you're talking about.  I think his name is David Prowse."
"__STAR_WARS__ Since he didn't voice Vader, I guess they don't seem inclined to stick up for him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, anyway can play Vader so they don't need to kiss up to him."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's the one actor you would never be able to spot since his most famous role called for him wearing a mask."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's gotta be a strange feeling."
