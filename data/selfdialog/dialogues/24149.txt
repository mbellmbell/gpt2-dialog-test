"__SUPERHERO__ So, what superhero movies are you looking forward to?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, definitely Wonder Woman.  I haven't seen that yet, and I hear it's REALLY good."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that's what i've heard as well."
"__SUPERHERO__ And of course, Avengers Infinity War.  I think they've teased us with Thanos quite enough times already.  Be nice to actually see what the guy can do."
"__SUPERHERO__ Thanos.. that's the dude with the purple skin right?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that's him.  Neat little inside tidbit.. remember at the end of the first Avengers movie where Thanos's assistant tells him that to attack the humans would be to 'court death'?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah I remember that?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, neatly enough, in the comics, Death is an actual character, a female, that Thanos is always trying to win the love of."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh, wow, so there's kind of a double meaning in that statement."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, but it's something only the people familiar with the comics would know about."
