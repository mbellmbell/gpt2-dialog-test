"__DISNEY__ Tomorrowland should have been a much better movie then it was."
"__DISNEY__ I was so excited to catch it and then was so disappointed, I agree."
"__DISNEY__ What problems did you have with Tomorrowland?"
"__DISNEY__ For me, I really liked the concept of turning what we know of Tomorrowland into a movie, but I thought the delivery of the storyline was a bit too much."
"__DISNEY__ Do you mean the George Clooney relationship with the girl?"
"__DISNEY__ I actually liked that aspect eventhough people thought it was somewhat controversial. I thought it was heartwarming that he had a crush on her as a kid, but seeing as she was a robot she wasn't going to age while he would."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't mind it either and I thought the dynamic of their relationship was really interesting. Overall the movie was fun but it lacked more coherence for me."
"__DISNEY__ Britt Robertson was almost like a throw away character in there even though she was the billing lead name."
"__DISNEY__ I know, her character was pretty disappointing. I didn't like the Hugh Laurie stuff either, that was weird."
"__DISNEY__ Brad Bird directed it, director of the Incredibles, and while I think he did a good job directing the movie, the story could have improved it overall so much more."
