"__STAR_WARS__ I'm so sad about Carrie Fisher dying. She made the first Star Wars movies so special."
"__STAR_WARS__ She really did. Princess Leia was one of the best parts of the original trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I feel like she was really independent in a way we don't get to see very often with women in action movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah! And her storyline is so compelling."
"__STAR_WARS__ She loses her home in the process of seeking justice."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. And she totally gets revenge for it too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke's story is also a revenge story, sort of."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, there's a lot of revenge going on."
"__STAR_WARS__ Everyone except Han. He's just in it for the money."
"__STAR_WARS__ Only at first!"
