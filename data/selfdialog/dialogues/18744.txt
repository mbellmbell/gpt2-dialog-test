"__MOVIES__ Hey, it's you again. We seem to meet often."
"__MOVIES__ It does appear that way. Are we doomed to repeat these conversations over and over again?"
"__MOVIES__ Not unlike that Groundhog Day movie with the delightful Bill Murray."
"__MOVIES__ And the not so delightful Geena Davis."
"__MOVIES__ You're thinking of the baseball flick with Madonna. I can see how you'd make the mistake. They're essentially the same."
"__MOVIES__ How do you figure that?"
"__MOVIES__ Groundhog Day is about a seemingly endless series of the same day and the baseball flick just seemed endless."
"__MOVIES__ If you like Groundhog Day, then you'd probably like another movie just like it called Primer. It's horribly overlooked."
"__MOVIES__ What!? They aren't the same at all. Groundhog Day is about a time loop and Primer is about time travel."
"__MOVIES__ They're both about time."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't mean that they're the same. That's like calling Oreos and Hydrox the same."
"__MOVIES__ They are the same. They both have white goo between two somewhat bitter chocolate wafers. How is that different?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, one is kosher."
"__MOVIES__ I think we're stuck in a loop. I'm going to punch you out like Bill Murray did to Ned in Groundhog Day."
"__MOVIES__ Here's an interesting factoid about the movie. Did you know that part of the movie was filmed in Racine, Wisconsin. The chase scene."
"__MOVIES__ There wasn't a chase scene. Have you been smokin' again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the one where they were chased by cops through a mall."
"__MOVIES__ That was Blues Brothers, you moron."
"__MOVIES__ I don't have to take this abuse. I'm leaving. I'm tapped out anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Thank god."
