"__BASKETBALL__ Do you ever think a no. 16 seed will beat a no. 1 seed in the tournament?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, of course not."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why is that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm totally on board for the no. 1 seed to lose to an 8/9 in the second round, but there is too much discrepancy."
"__BASKETBALL__ Everyone keeps getting better, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but the rich keep getting richer. And the committee makes it nearly impossible for the small guys to win."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's even more apparent in the women's tournament."
"__BASKETBALL__ How so?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, in the mens, there are usually 8-10 teams who could realistically win the whole thing."
"__BASKETBALL__ And in the womens?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It'll be UConn, Stanford, Notre Dame, or South Carolina."
"__BASKETBALL__ Every year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Close enough. Since 2000, UConn has won 10 champsionships."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who else has won it all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ South Carolina this year, Baylor, Texas A&M, Maryland, Tennessee, and Notre Dame."
"__BASKETBALL__ So 7 different champions in 17 years, that's not good."
"__BASKETBALL__ No, it's not. They're all top seeds, too."
"__BASKETBALL__ How's that compare to the men?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Lots of top seeds, but more variety: UNC, Villanova, Duke, UConn, Louisville, Kentucky, Kansas, Florida, Syracuse, Maryland, Michigan State."
"__BASKETBALL__ And, lower seeds, too. Got it."
