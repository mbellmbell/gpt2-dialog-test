"__MUSIC__ So what kind of music do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Mainly ska, hip hop and melodic folk metal."
"__MUSIC__ Ska?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know what that is."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, well it's a fun style of music that typically has a walking baseline, and horns, and there are similar themes in the lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Is it like Jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ No, although I've heard some artists incorporate jazz styles into some of their songs."
"__MUSIC__ Hmm, sounds interesting."
"__MUSIC__ It really is. The horns are probably my favourite part, so I like more third wave Ska myself."
"__MUSIC__ How many waves are there?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there's first wave which came out of Jamaica in the 60's, then there's 2-tone ska which I'm not as familiar with but it came around in the 70's, and then my favourite, third wave ska surged from the 80's on."
"__MUSIC__ And it's the one with all the horns."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it has the biggest horn sections of the 3 installments of Ska."
"__MUSIC__ You'll have to introduce me to some of your favourite bands sometime."
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to. I actually don't know anyone who's familiar with Ska who doesn't love it."
"__MUSIC__ Well that sounds promising!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! There's even a dance people do to it that's called 'skanking'."
"__MUSIC__ I'm all about that."
"__MUSIC__ Great! I could use someone to skank with."
