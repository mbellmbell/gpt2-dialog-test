"__MOVIES__ Want to get the kids together for a movie this weekend?"
"__MOVIES__ It depends whats playing. Zoe can be pretty picky about movies."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, let me check whats playing."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, Dispicable 3 and Cars 3 are playing on Saturday."
"__MOVIES__ Despicable Me was really cute, did your kids like it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they loved it and the second one."
"__MOVIES__ What about cars?"
"__MOVIES__ They liked that one too."
"__MOVIES__ Did they like the second one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but it wasn't as good as the first."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, I'm not sure which one we should go see. What do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the kids will like either. Despicable 3 will probably be the easiest one for us to sit through."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah cars is kind of boring."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, should I get tickets for Despicable 3?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes lets go see that one."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, I'm excited"
"__MOVIES__ Me too, the kids will be stoked."
"__MOVIES__ Alright I got tickets for the 3 pm Saturday showing."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds great. We'll be there."
