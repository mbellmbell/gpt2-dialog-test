"__STAR_WARS__ In your opinion, what is one thing you would change about the Star Wars series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would remove all the love scenes. The scenes with Annakin trying to flirt are so cringy and terrible. It was cool when Han Solo did it, but Annakin was terrible."
"__STAR_WARS__ Haha, That's hilarious. I was thinking about making better visuals for the empire strikes back, but you made a really good point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, its ridiculous how stupid the love scenes are with annakin, its no surprise that actor is not in any other movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. So what would you say the best battle scene is?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Either the fight on planet hoth or the fight in the big arena with jedi and droids."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow those are two really good choices. I'd have to pick the one between jedi and droids because there was better graphic editing."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, once they developed more movies they started having way better visuals than in the past."
"__STAR_WARS__ There's something nostalgic feeling about watching the old fight scenes though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely, I love all the old movies as much as the new ones."
