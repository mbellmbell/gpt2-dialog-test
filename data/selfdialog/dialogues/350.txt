"__MUSIC__ Have you ever experienced crystal bowl music?"
"__MUSIC__ No. But it is an interesting way to ask. Why the word experience and not just heard?"
"__MUSIC__ Because it a sound unlike anything else and each bowl has it's own voice."
"__MUSIC__ You have me curious now."
"__MUSIC__ When you are in the same room with someone playing a crystal bowl the sound fills the whole room with that one note."
"__MUSIC__ okay that is a little bizarre. I am not sure I see the point but go on."
"__MUSIC__ Each bowl is  tuned to a particular note which in turn is in key with a certain chakra."
"__MUSIC__ So you are saying that it affects you physically?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! Now if you have the ability to have several bowls with different notes you get some amazing sounds going on."
"__MUSIC__ What does it do for you? Doesn't it hurt your ears after a while?"
"__MUSIC__ No not at all! It's wonderful especially if you lay down on the floor or somewhere and close your eyes. The music and sound is so incredible."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds pretty neat the more you explain it to me."
"__MUSIC__ There are people who have  all 8 notes for each chakra  and will play them in sequence so you can feel it in the location of your body that is specifically tuned to"
"__MUSIC__ Are there mp3s you can find of this? I know it won't have the same effect as being in the room but I still want to hear them"
"__MUSIC__ yes there are a lot out there plus some of them are accompanied by chanting or didgeridoo"
"__MUSIC__ I like didgeridoo music it's so awesome."
"__MUSIC__ yes I like it as well"
"__MUSIC__ I am really excited about listening to this crystal bowl music."
"__MUSIC__ There are Tibetan brass bowls that are used in some of these sessions as well"
"__MUSIC__ Don't give me any more to think about!!!"
