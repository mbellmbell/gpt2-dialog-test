"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the Golden state Warriors versus the Utah Jazz Playoff Game 3?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah.  It was the closest game yet. The Jazz seem to be losing by exactly 11 points each of the past 2 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ It was amazingly close considering the Jazz  have been playing without Guard George Hill for two straight games."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think the Warriors would have blown the Jazz out if Draymond Green didn't get in foul trouble and if steph' and Klay weren't throwing up bricks all night."
"__BASKETBALL__ True.  Steph' Curry and Klay Tompson were really ice cold shooting."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah,.  By contrast Jazz Shelvin Mack was THE playmaker for the Jazz- scoring, playing hard defense while most of the other players seemed to not be interested."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Jazz played well the 1st half leading by 2 points.  But after that, it was all downhill."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Jazz couldn't hit the broad side of a barn in the second half............"
"__BASKETBALL__ While the Warriors were getting the ball to Durant and playing the type of ball that got them into the playoffs again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Rudy Gobert and Gordon Hayward were indecisive and gave open shots to guys like Joe Johnson who never shot well."
"__BASKETBALL__ If the Jazz get Gobert and Hayward involved and let them shoot at will they have a chance of extending the series at least one more game."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Warriors are a good defense team but the Jazz were ranked higher  defensively during the regular season."
"__BASKETBALL__ That means nothing in the playoffs..............."
"__BASKETBALL__ It looks like Rudy Gobert will be playing in the next playoff game. Hopefully he'll bring his shooting ability with him."
"__BASKETBALL__ He's only scored 21 points on his best game so far this series!"
"__BASKETBALL__ I know but he is a rebounding machine- 15 rebounds in his best game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Rebounds are good but if a team can't shoot............"
"__BASKETBALL__ Utah shot 7/22 from outside in this game which is not very good for them."
"__BASKETBALL__ If steph' Curry and Kevin Durant score 30 plus points each in the next game the party  is over for the Jazz.  I see a Warriors sweep coming!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Rudy Gobert and Gordon Hayward need to be on fire shooting for this next game.  I think that they will be and will carry the Jazz to victory."
