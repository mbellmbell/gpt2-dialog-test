"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey what do you think about the Saints signing Peterson?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am skeptical about Adrian Peterson myself. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you because everyone is doubtful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was also wondering how much longer that Tom Brady will play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes a lot of doubt s surrounding that subject too actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I don't know how old Brady is now? Do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he about 41 years old now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh okay, that is old for a quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How old was Kurt Warner?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe he was about the same age as Brady, actaully."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Packers have Aaron Rogers and he is awesome! How old is he now a days?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rogers is 33 years old this year and at his peak, I believe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Rogers did not get very good blocking last year and I hope they beef up the line up this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah seriously!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you heard any new linebackers being recruited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really keep up with the Packers as much as I should."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that time flies during off season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I like the Red Zone because I get the highlights and stay informed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, The Red Zone is always on at my house!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My tv is set to record that every single week!"
