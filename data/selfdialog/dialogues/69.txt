"__MUSIC__ I love rap music!"
"__MUSIC__ Same here so who is your favorite artist right now?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Kendrick Lamar. He is definitely the King of Rap right now."
"__MUSIC__ He is definitely a great rapper. I feel bad for Childish Gambino."
"__MUSIC__ Gambino is also a great rapper. Why do you feel bad for him?"
"__MUSIC__ Did you hear he is quitting rap to just focus on acting? I am not sure why!"
"__MUSIC__ That is his choice you don't have to feel bad!"
"__MUSIC__ I just feel bad because I don't think he ever got the recognition he deserved as a rapper."
"__MUSIC__ He definitely has some great songs. I was obsessed with his song Freaks and Greeks when it came out."
"__MUSIC__ That is a great one. He is a much better rapper then he is actor but I guess he enjoys acting more."
"__MUSIC__ Then if that is what he likes to do he should do that. Just because we like his music we can't force him to write it."
"__MUSIC__ You are correct about that. I definitely need to just let Childish Gambino follow his heart."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe someday he will miss rapping and want to come back to it."
"__MUSIC__ I can only hope that happens! At least one of the last songs he ever wrote was incredible."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard it yet. What is it called?"
"__MUSIC__ It is called Redbone. It is a great song."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting what do you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ It is really unique. I have never heard Chilidish Gambino write a song just like this yet I still see it as one of his bests."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds amazing I defintely will listen."
"__MUSIC__ Great it was nice talking to you about Rap music!"
