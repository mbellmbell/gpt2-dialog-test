"__MUSIC__ Who's playing right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh this is that new SOB X RBE, just got it."
"__MUSIC__ Sound great, where are they from?"
"__MUSIC__ Vallejo, somewhere around there."
"__MUSIC__ This is a different style, the way they are riding this beat."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's like they are ahead of it or something."
"__MUSIC__ Rhyming on the up beat."
"__MUSIC__ I was just going to say that."
"__MUSIC__ Are they playing live any time soon?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe some local shows, nothing we'd hear about down here."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe we should go up there, then."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't mind that. There's some cute girls in Vallejo."
"__MUSIC__ And you know this. Good music, too."
"__MUSIC__ I know right? Mac Mall, E40 and them..."
"__MUSIC__ Remember that E40 show we went to a few years ago?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh snap I almost forgot. That was bananas."
"__MUSIC__ The crowd was too turned up."
"__MUSIC__ I know, it was packed wall to wall."
"__MUSIC__ Too bad the sound system was wack."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah it was, wasn't it? We could barely hear anyone up there."
