"__MUSIC__ I absolutely love groove metal music."
"__MUSIC__ Like Pantera?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Pantera basically popularized it, so yeah?"
"__MUSIC__ True. Vulgar Display of Power is a prime album for groove metal."
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget about Cowboys From Hell. That one started it all."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I'm also partial to Sacrament or Ashes of the Wake."
"__MUSIC__ Those aren't Pantera albums."
"__MUSIC__ I know. They're Lamb of God albums."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. I forget that those are groove albums."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Lamb of God are to groove what Pantera was during the 90s."
"__MUSIC__ Its a shame what became of Pantera."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it is. I wish that they didn't end on such a bitter note."
"__MUSIC__ Not to mention Dimebag's death."
"__MUSIC__ I'd like to think that there'd be a better chance of a Pantera reunion if Dime was still alive."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. At least their members are doing alright."
"__MUSIC__ Phil has kind of been in a bad state lately."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ He's been accused of being a neo-Nazi of all things. That, and his voice just isn't that good anymore."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know about the first one. I agree with the second one, though."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame what age and drugs do to someone."
