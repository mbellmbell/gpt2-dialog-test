"__DISNEY__ Did you hear Cars 3 is out this weekend?"
"__DISNEY__ Already? I had no idea!"
"__DISNEY__ We should go see it."
"__DISNEY__ What time do you want to go?"
"__DISNEY__ It doesn't matter, but I'm exicted to see it!"
"__DISNEY__ I heard it was sad."
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean it's sad? Does something happen to Lightning McQueen?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't know it's just what I heard."
"__DISNEY__ I'm avoiding the internet for this one because I don't want to ruin it."
"__DISNEY__ That's fine I still want to see it!"
