"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Can you believe Snoop Dogg is still touring?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know, it's crazy. He's getting old."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's even crazier that he still has so much support."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, but he's a legend. Those types of people will always have fan support."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's true. He's been doing it for a very long time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Didn't he try to change his name to Snoop Lion?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I think he actually did, but everyone still calls him Snoop Dogg."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's hard to get a change like that to stick."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ For sure. 'Gin and Juice' is stuck in my head now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That song is a classic."
