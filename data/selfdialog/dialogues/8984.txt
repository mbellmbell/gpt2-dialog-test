"__BEATLES__ Have you listened to a lot of the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Actually, I guess I'm weird.  I never really saw the big deal with them."
"__BEATLES__ I guess I feel the same way."
"__BEATLES__ I do like some of their songs, but not any more than I like other group's songs."
"__BEATLES__ So what songs do you like?"
"__BEATLES__ I guess my favorite would be 'Jude'."
"__BEATLES__ Isn't that the one that they thought was written about drugs?"
"__BEATLES__ I've heard that.  I don't know.   I just like it because I think it sounds good."
"__BEATLES__ I like it too.  I don't know of any other ones of theirs that I think too much about."
"__BEATLES__ I know they did a lot of songs, but I feel that same way."
