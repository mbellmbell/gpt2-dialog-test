"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Seahawks may just be trending downwards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they still have a great defense, but you could be right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you have faith in Russell Wilson?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do, but he isn't the kind of guy to lead a team alone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well nobody really is, but I know what you mean."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but I mean like a Flacco. Great quarterback, but you need a defense and playmakers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand. Wilson still has a couple receivers and a tight end so he may still be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, they will still compete, but I'm not sure they have enough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of Flacco. How about the Ravens?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh, they added Maclin this year, but I think they have more holes than that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. They probably can't top the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, the Steelers are still contenders, aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure are and they have a great time again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well if Leveon Bell can get his act together and stop getting suspended."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I hope he can get himself straightened out. He is too good of a running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, especially when he is on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, with Roethlisberger, him, and Brown, they should be a force."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. Thats a great trio!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, it is. Just always question Big Ben's health."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he does seem to be prone to injury sometimes."
