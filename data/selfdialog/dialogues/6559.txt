"__STAR_WARS__ Was Bobba Fett the greatest Star Wars character of all time?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Quite possibly. He was really cool looking"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, what was his back story?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they tried to address it in the prequels, but I didn't follow it too much"
"__STAR_WARS__ His dad was the clone for the stormtroopers"
"__STAR_WARS__ Something like that"
"__STAR_WARS__ His death was a little underwhelming"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I heard some people are trying to say he survived the sarlaac pit"
"__STAR_WARS__ How could he survive that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Who knows. Maybe he blasted out with his rocket pack."
