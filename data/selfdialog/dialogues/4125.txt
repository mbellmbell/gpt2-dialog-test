"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the new Whitechapel album?"
"__MUSIC__ I really didn't like it. It sounds too much like their last two."
"__MUSIC__ I'm glad I'm not alone on that one."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame that they're starting to get so repetitive so soon."
"__MUSIC__ I know. They finally made themselves unique from every other deathcore band, but they made it get old really quick."
"__MUSIC__ It was such a pleasant surprise on their self-titled album."
"__MUSIC__ That one's still my favorite of theirs. Even if it set the tone for their last two bad albums, it still did it far better than they did."
"__MUSIC__ Mine is probably This is Exile."
"__MUSIC__ That one's a deathcore classic."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly why I like it. I know that deathcore is considered a fad by a lot of metal fans, but it's one of my favorite styles because of this album."
"__MUSIC__ That kind of makes me sad, because when Whitechapel first came on the scene, they were so much heavier than other bands."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Phil Bozeman's vocals beat out just about anyone else."
"__MUSIC__ Even Suicide Silence didn't sound as heavy as they did."
"__MUSIC__ As boring as the new Whitechapel was, though, it was still far better than the new Suicide Silence."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man. I hated that album."
"__MUSIC__ Same here, but I didn't hate it because of the sound change."
"__MUSIC__ Me either. I hated it because they just didn't do it well at all."
"__MUSIC__ I was just about to say that. I had to listen to old school Korn just to remind myself who did that style better."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of funny, but sad at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ All too true."
