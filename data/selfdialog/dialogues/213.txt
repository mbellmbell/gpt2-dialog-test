"__MUSIC__ What do you think about the stereotype for country music?"
"__MUSIC__ I think its a little ridiculous honestly."
"__MUSIC__ Are you a country fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I am, and I am a country girl so I love the music. I can relate to it."
"__MUSIC__ Is it true that if you play country backwards, your dog and wife come back?"
"__MUSIC__ That is a funny joke honestly, but who knows!"
"__MUSIC__ I can say that I am not a huge fan of the stereotype either."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it is not all redneck drunks that listen to country."
"__MUSIC__ I think I once heard that the country music genre has the most bass of any genre."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard that too, but I doubt it is true."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, seems a little far fetched."
"__MUSIC__ So do you prefer old country or these new country genres?"
"__MUSIC__ I like the older stuff, I think then newer stuff sounds too much like pop music."
"__MUSIC__ That we agree on, I do no listen to much of the new stuff at all."
"__MUSIC__ I like stuff like Tim Mcgraw, Allan Jackson, old Kenny Chesney, etc."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! The good old music was the best."
"__MUSIC__ Those artists still make music, but I do not like it much."
"__MUSIC__ I like a couple of newer songs that Kenny Chesney has done."
"__MUSIC__ Yes same here, but not very many."
"__MUSIC__ Tim Mcgraw is still making hits though."
