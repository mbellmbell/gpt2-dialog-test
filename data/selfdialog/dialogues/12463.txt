"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, did you hear what Brady's wife said a few weeks back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ About the concussions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. She said like he comes home with them or something like that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, there was a story on NFL.com about it i think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems that no one asked him directly about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And it seemed like either Billachek or the Patriots tried to cover it up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they were moe like trying to sweep it under the rug like it never happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he looks fine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True and he seems coherent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it's really up to Brady to deal with this problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought there was a commission that looked into concussions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think there is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wonder what they think about this."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's tricky. the NFL is a multi-billion dollar industry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True but if you have no players....."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There will always be players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but not good ones if you got to get new ones year after year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, it really is Brady's problem. He knows when he is hit or not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but he may just want to push thru the pain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dunno. It's a unique world in the NFL."
