"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What can we expect from the 2017 NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Expect more stability and less drama. Politics should play less a part, and the focus will be more on football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about rules changes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL seems to be clueless about what the rules are supposed to accomplish, and after some encouraging recent ideas the league keeps trying to fix what isn't broken."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is overtime an area of interest?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Overtime should be eliminated in the regular season. It is a device designed to break a tie, and there is no need to break a tie in the regular season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are the new stadiums a benefit to the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. This is the third clearly-definable stadium boom in league history, but the new buildings detract from the game instead of enhancing it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are some mid-level contenders that might become wild-card playoff teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Buffalo Bills are one. Stability and focus on football should help the upstate New York team make progress. Tyrod Taylor is underrated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What other mid-level teams show promise?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Bengals keep coming back for more, and the Saints might string some wins together if Drew Brees stays fit and able."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any others? Like Minnesota?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Vikings are a gritty outfit that needs a few breaks, but their mindset is good thanks to Mike Zimmer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What goliaths are shadows of their former selves?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Packers are an odd duck, a passing game with hardly anything else. They hardly evoke the Mike Holmgren & Brett Favre successes, let alone the glory years of Lombardi and Starr."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the Giants fit in this category also?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. After Manning, who is there on the roster who is truly reliable? The talent is there in spots, but can it be counted on?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the Steelers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A good team with a good coach and good quarterback, but — much like the Packers — there isn't much else to get excited about, aside from James Harrison."
