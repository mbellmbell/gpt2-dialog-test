"__MOVIES__ I was thinking about going to the cinema. Do you know if there are any good films playing?"
"__MOVIES__ It depends, what kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ I want to see an action movie. I'm okay with any movie really, as long as it has a lot of action in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh no, I like comedies. Action movies are so over rated."
"__MOVIES__ What are you talking about? There is nothing more enjoyable than a movie with crimes scenes and fighting--"
"__MOVIES__ Half the time you can tell it's all fake!"
"__MOVIES__ I must agree with you there. Some films do exaggerate a little bit."
"__MOVIES__ A little bit! The actor falls from a 10 story building, lands on a car and walks away with a few scratches!"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, okay! I have seen some exaggerated scenes but they still get my adrenaline pumping."
"__MOVIES__ Comedies are much more entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah, but it also depends on the actor. I've seen some pretty bad comedy movies too!"
"__MOVIES__ I only watch the movie if I know that the actor is good and actually funny."
"__MOVIES__ When I told my wife I was thinking about going to the cinema, she said she wants to take the kids."
"__MOVIES__ In that case, you're definitely not going to watch an action movie."
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it! She's already looking for a good kid's movie. I hate cartoon movies!"
"__MOVIES__ I totally agree with you. Kid's films are always so silly and childish."
"__MOVIES__ Last time we went I spent a fortune on snacks and the film was about a bunch of cartoon ants!"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we could do a double family date...our wives can take the kids to a children's movie and we can watch a comedy!"
"__MOVIES__ You mean an ACTION film!!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man! There's just no pleasing everyone, is there?"
