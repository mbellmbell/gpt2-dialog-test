"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely Return of the Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a good one. Why is it your favorite?"

"__STAR_WARS__ I like the Ewoks too! But honestly, I like Empire Strikes Back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Empire was good. Why was it your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like how they gave Princess Leia a little more airtime in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Very true, she didn't get as much attention as she should have."

"__STAR_WARS__ Me too! I can't wait for Episode 8."
