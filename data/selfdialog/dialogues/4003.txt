"__MUSIC__ I don't know anything about classical music, but I started dating a girl who's really into it."
"__MUSIC__ Are you going to try to learn something about it."
"__MUSIC__ I think I have to. I lied and said I was a big fan."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't. That's a huge mistake!"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know what else to do. It happened before I could say anything."
"__MUSIC__ So what do you know about classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Um. I know a couple by Beethoven."
"__MUSIC__ That's a start. What do you know?"
"__MUSIC__ Ode to Joy? And the one that goes bum-bum-bum-bum-bum."
"__MUSIC__ That's his fifth. But that's really not much to go on!"
"__MUSIC__ I know. This is a disaster."
"__MUSIC__ Okay. What kind of music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like pop music. Basically anything that comes on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think that will impress a girl who's into classical music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what do you think I should do?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe just come clean?"
"__MUSIC__ I feel like that's a bad idea."
"__MUSIC__ No, I think being honest is correct."
"__MUSIC__ I really can't just study?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it would take a lifetime to learn enough about classical music!"
