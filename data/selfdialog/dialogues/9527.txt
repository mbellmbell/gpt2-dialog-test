"__BASEBALL__ Do you think we will see the end of the closer position?"
"__BASEBALL__ I do. Its a meaningless stat nowadays"
"__BASEBALL__ The game has evolved and teams need outs not guys for specific innings."
"__BASEBALL__ I always thought that having a guy for one specific inning was a bit bizarre."
"__BASEBALL__ Same here, I think that they need to get guys out when they come up in the order."
"__BASEBALL__ If the meat of the lineup is in the 8th then send out your best pen arm then."
"__BASEBALL__ More coaches will ascribe to that  in my opinion."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they should be able to pitch for 2 innings a time."
"__BASEBALL__ Try to get max effort from the arm"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah you need to see how many pitches were thrown"
"__BASEBALL__ Too many teams have just seen the outs and then been done."
"__BASEBALL__ RIght so if a guy comes in with a runner on first and throws one pitch and gets 2 outs, why cant he come and pitch the next inning?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it never made sense but guys what to know their roles."
"__BASEBALL__ Their role should be to pitch when called."
"__BASEBALL__ Those dudes out in the pen are creatures of habit."
"__BASEBALL__ So you establish early on that no one has a specific inning."
"__BASEBALL__ That would be a culture change across the game."
"__BASEBALL__ The name of the game is to win"
"__BASEBALL__ You are changing the landscape of one third of your team"
"__BASEBALL__ For the positive though"
