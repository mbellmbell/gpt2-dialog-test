"__HORROR__ Are you a fan of horror movies?"
"__HORROR__ No, I'm a bit of a wimp. Maybe I have an overactive imagination."
"__HORROR__ It always surprises me how many are coming out in theaters. It seems like there are a few new ones every month."
"__HORROR__ I always associate these movies with Halloween and specific circumstances, but it's really an all year thing."
"__HORROR__ I've only seen a few in theaters, but you're right, I don't think they were around Halloween."
"__HORROR__ Have you seen The Grudge? I saw that one in the theater and couldn't ride an elevator alone for a few weeks after."
"__HORROR__ That was a scary one. It was more something jumping out at you and surprising you than just being a scary concept."
"__HORROR__ The Sixth Sense got me too. That was more a scary concept than the shocks every few minutes."
"__HORROR__ And of course the great twist at the end."
"__HORROR__ A very good movie, but still made me want to sleep with the light on for a few days."
