"__THRILLER__ I am in the mood to see a movie tonight!"
"__THRILLER__ Me too. How do you feel about seeing a thriller movie?"
"__THRILLER__ I love thriller movies. The last one that I saw was Don't Breathe."
"__THRILLER__ I don't think that I ever saw that one. Did you like it?"
"__THRILLER__ It was alright. I would not watch it again."
"__THRILLER__ Well, The Mummy is playing in theaters now. How do you feel about seeing that?"
"__THRILLER__ I love the Mummy movies! I did not know a new one was out."
"__THRILLER__ This one is starring Tom Cruise. I don't think it has any of the old cast members."
"__THRILLER__ Anything with Tom Cruise is good."
"__THRILLER__ Agreed! What time do you want to see it tonight?"
