"__MOVIES__ I just watched Frozen for the first time."
"__MOVIES__ Have you been living under an iceberg?"
"__MOVIES__ I just refused to watch it because of the hype around it."
"__MOVIES__ I get what you mean. I didn't give it a chance until a year after it came out."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it."
"__MOVIES__ I did. Did you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I think it had the best songs from any Disney movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's not true. But the songs were great."
"__MOVIES__ Which Disney one has better songs?"
"__MOVIES__ Mulan."
"__MOVIES__ No, Frozen wins hands down."
"__MOVIES__ Which song is the best?"
"__MOVIES__ Let it go, of course."
"__MOVIES__ I can't lie, I know all the words to that."
"__MOVIES__ I hope there's like a remix or something in the next one."
"__MOVIES__ There's going to be a new Frozen?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I think its in 2018."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not surprised. Its gonna be like a billion dollar release."
"__MOVIES__ Probably. I hope Olaf is just as funny."
"__MOVIES__ He will be. He's a huge draw for the kids."
