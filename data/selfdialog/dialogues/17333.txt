"__MOVIES__ I saw the top two grossing anime movies in Japan for 2016 recently."
"__MOVIES__ What were they called?"
"__MOVIES__ 'A Silent Voice' and 'Your Name'."
"__MOVIES__ Which one was better?"
"__MOVIES__ Both had me in tears, and both had incredible storylines and aesthetic qualities."
"__MOVIES__ You have to pick one. Which did you see first and what was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ I'll pick 'Your Name', which I saw first and it was about a boy and a girl who switch bodies and are trying to meet despite living in different times."
"__MOVIES__ What was the other one about?"
"__MOVIES__ A reformed bully who seeks redemption for the suffering he caused a deaf girl in his class."
"__MOVIES__ Wow... were these Miyazaki-level movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely, especially 'Your Name'.  It also had a great soundtrack by a band called The Radwimps."
"__MOVIES__ What did the movies have in common?"
"__MOVIES__ Beautiful to look at and extremely emotionally nuanced with no black and white characters."
"__MOVIES__ Do similar movies - particularly animated ones - exist in Hollywood?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not."
"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about the storylines in Disney movies?"
"__MOVIES__ They are extremely linear, but they are beautiful movies. They have too many songs though."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I prefer how Japanese movies interlace music into the mood of the film without constantly making music the focus."
"__MOVIES__ If you want mature animated films, watch both of these."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to wait until they are legal to stream!"
