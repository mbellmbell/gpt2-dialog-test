"__MOVIES__ Do you remember how great Disney Channel Original Movies were?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I still watch a few of them every year. Not the new ones, though."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely not the new ones. Which ones do you watch?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, The Luck of the Irish is on every March, that's my favorite."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, same here. I wonder what happened to those actors?"
"__MOVIES__ I know the guy who played Kyle was in a few other things and the girl is a model now."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. Which other ones do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Obviously Halloweentown 1, 2, and 3. Everyone loves those."
"__MOVIES__ Those will never get old. I didn't like Halloweentown High, though."
"__MOVIES__ Same. I hate when series change characters."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I couldnt' finish it since the main character was different."
"__MOVIES__ Smart House is great, too."
"__MOVIES__ I remember the woman who played the smart house scaring me as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ I know, that part was a bit creepy."
"__MOVIES__ High school musical?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the first 2. I never saw the one that was in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ Neither did I."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite would have to be Jonny Tsunami, though."
"__MOVIES__ I completely forgot about that one!"
"__MOVIES__ I havent seen it in years."
