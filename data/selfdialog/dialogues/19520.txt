"__MOVIES__ Do you follow all the Star Wars movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen every one of them."
"__MOVIES__ I read the books too.  But I really love the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear about the Han Solo Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  It's not really in the series, but it's still considered a Star Wars movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's a prequel?"
"__MOVIES__ No Harrison Ford?"
"__MOVIES__ He's too old now to play himself at that age."
"__MOVIES__ That's too bad, because he used to be really hot."
"__MOVIES__ He still is, just too old to play himself before Star Wars 4, which is really the first one that came out."
"__MOVIES__ That really confuses my Mom.  She was a teenager when that one came out.  She likes to call that the first movie."
"__MOVIES__ My Dad is like that.  They must be about the same age."
"__MOVIES__ Sigh.... I  can't imagine being that old."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of old...I understand that Ron Howard has taken over as director."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, isn't he like, as old as our parents?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  His kids are our age.  or older."
"__MOVIES__ What happened to the other directors?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know."
"__MOVIES__ I don't either.  Something about 'creative differences'?"
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't matter.  We know Mr. Howard will do a great job!"
