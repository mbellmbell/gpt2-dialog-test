"__MUSIC__ Lately I've been getting into the music of an old band called The Monkees."
"__MUSIC__ I know who they are. They were supposed to be America's version of the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ I think they had a lot of good songs."
"__MUSIC__ What are some of your favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ I love their theme song and Steppin Stone is one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ That song is good, but I think A Little Bit Me A Little Bit You is better."
"__MUSIC__ That's debateable. I guess it depends on who your favorite Monkee is."
"__MUSIC__ Which one is your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like Mickey's voice. He can rock out when he wants to."
"__MUSIC__ I like the softness of Davey's voice and I loved his song I Wanna Be Free."
"__MUSIC__ I was sad when I found out he died."
"__MUSIC__ You know, they do a tribute of him while on tour."
"__MUSIC__ They're still touring?"
"__MUSIC__ Mickey and Peter are."
"__MUSIC__ Are they still putting out albums?"
"__MUSIC__ They last released one in 2016."
"__MUSIC__ What's it called?"
