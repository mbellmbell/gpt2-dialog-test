"__DISNEY__ When is Disney going to release 'Song of the South'?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean on DVD? I don't know - it might make people angry."
"__DISNEY__ How can it make you angry? It is such a beautiful film."
"__DISNEY__ Don't get me wrong - I'm a fan. But it comes off as pretty racist."
"__DISNEY__ Disney has released other movies that can come off as racist as well. Just look at Peter Pan."
"__DISNEY__ I guess in their mind acceptability of racism depends on race."
"__DISNEY__ I am partly a fan of the movie because Splash Mountain is my favorite ride."
"__DISNEY__ I would bet there are people out there riding that ride who don't even know it's based on a movie."
"__DISNEY__ I think you are right. In fact, I think most people don't know."
"__DISNEY__ That's sad to me. 'Zipadeedoodah' is so much fun."
