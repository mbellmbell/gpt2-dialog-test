"__STAR_WARS__ What is the greatest weapon in the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Force!"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I mean a physical weapon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, in that case it is Chewbacca's bowcaster."
"__STAR_WARS__ How is that the greatest weapon?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's just cool. I mean it's a laser crossbow. How can anything compete with that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Laser Swords? Perhaps?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yeah, I guess the lightsaber is really the coolest."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's my favorite, but you can pick the bowcaster if you want."
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope, I am switching to Light Saber."
