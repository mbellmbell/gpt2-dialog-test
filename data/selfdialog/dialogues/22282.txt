"__DISNEY__ How do you feel about them making another Toy Story sequel?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not too fond of it, I thought they had a great ending with the third film."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, honestly I didn't think there needed to be a Toy Story 2 or 3 either."
"__DISNEY__ I mean, however you look at it they're fun sequels to a children movie, but agreed."
"__DISNEY__ But what I'm also saying is, I didn't think they needed to exist and both sequels were great films."
"__DISNEY__ That's very true, it's hard to distrust Disney and Pixar at this point."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely, they can really do no wrong in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Indeed, even their lesser films are successful and worth the watch."
"__DISNEY__ Indeed, similar to Finding Dory."
"__DISNEY__ Hmmm, see I can't agree I actually hated Finding Dory."
