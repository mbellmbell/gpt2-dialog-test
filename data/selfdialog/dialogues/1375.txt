"__MUSIC__ I just heard this band for the first time and I'm completely amazed by them."
"__MUSIC__ Which band?"
"__MUSIC__ They're called Primus."
"__MUSIC__ I've heard of them.  Their lead singer plays bass doesn't he?"
"__MUSIC__ He does.  His name is Les Claypool."
"__MUSIC__ If I remember correctly, he's really good or something right?"
"__MUSIC__ I think a lot of people would say that he's really good at bass."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I remember a song from them called Shake Hands with Beef."
"__MUSIC__ That song is a pretty good example of why people think he's good at bass."
"__MUSIC__ He's got that funky slap bass style."
"__MUSIC__ He sure does, but he's also a really unique and creative song writer."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think he's unique?"
"__MUSIC__ Because the style of his songs are centered around the bass and use the percussion and guitar as a supporting cast."
"__MUSIC__ There's other bands with lead singing bassists though."
"__MUSIC__ But Primus handles the situation differently and the bass is the centerpiece."
"__MUSIC__ How is it different?"
"__MUSIC__ For example, the bass will literally drive the music while the guitar will play something completely different and has an almost ambient sound."
"__MUSIC__ That is different, most rock bands have the guitar playing a lot of chords."
"__MUSIC__ He also plays an upright bass at times, which is incredibly unique for the genre."
"__MUSIC__ I've definitely never seen a rock band using an upright bass."
