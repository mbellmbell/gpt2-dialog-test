"__POP__ Ever heard of Kimbra? She's a pop artist from New Zealand, I think."
"__POP__ Oh, yeah! I love her!"
"__POP__ Me too! Both her first and second albums are so good."
"__POP__ I agree, but I prefer The Golden Echo."
"__POP__ Yeah, she did a lot of growing up on that album."
"__POP__ True. Her songs are much more mature with a lot of deep lyrics."
"__POP__ Except for 90's Music. That one was just really fun."
"__POP__ Actually, I really found it to be about her growing up. The lyrics are about how she's grown up but she still misses and loves that time."
"__POP__ And she's clearly talking about some old lover she had."
"__POP__ That is such a great album."
