"__MUSIC__ I can't stop listening to the song 'Die Young' by Sylvan Esso! Have you heard it?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually have! I was a very big fan of Mountain Man, Amelia Meath's original bluegrass project."
"__MUSIC__ She has such a different sound with Sylvan Esso."
"__MUSIC__ But somehow it still works."
"__MUSIC__ As electronica."
"__MUSIC__ Nick Sanborn's solo-stuff as Made of Oak is interesting, but..."
"__MUSIC__ They're best when they're together."
"__MUSIC__ My thoughts exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Did you catch Sylvan Esso on Jimmy Fallon?"
"__MUSIC__ When was that again?"
"__MUSIC__ End of last year, I think. December?"
"__MUSIC__ Ah yes! They did their song, 'Radio,' right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they did! They got a lot of exposure through that performance."
"__MUSIC__ And they are on this tour this summer, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep! I actually am going to see them in Washington D.C. this weekend!"
"__MUSIC__ We should go together! Want a concert buddy?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure! I would love to go. They'll also be in Brooklyn in July."
"__MUSIC__ Why not see them twice?"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good to me!"
"__MUSIC__ I'll get tickets."
