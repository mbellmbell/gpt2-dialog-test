"__MOVIES__ What was the last movie you saw?"
"__MOVIES__ I just saw White Chicks."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was funny."
"__MOVIES__ It was ok, it had it's moments."
"__MOVIES__ Oh come on.  Like Terry Cruz didn't crack you up the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, that guy was hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ The way he just kept coming after that poor girl.  If you can call her that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and how could no one tell how ugly they looked."
"__MOVIES__ That laugh they had was funny too."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right.  It was pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Like when the girl started freaking out while shopping."
"__MOVIES__ Or when the FBI guy sniffed and licked the panties."
"__MOVIES__ That was gross.  He's such a meathead."
"__MOVIES__ How about when they started rapping."
"__MOVIES__ That was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Another part when she farted in front of Terry Cruz."
"__MOVIES__ And he basically just farted back."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing she could do would turn him off haha."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was the best character in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Best line 'you end up in a wheel chair."
