"__MUSIC__ Hey, you took music theory, right?"
"__MUSIC__ I have three degrees in it. You know I have my PhD in theory."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right, the throwaway class."
"__MUSIC__ I've never had someone take it as a throwaway class because they always fail. You can't wing this class."
"__MUSIC__ So, favorite...chord?"
"__MUSIC__ You'll regret that question."
"__MUSIC__ I already do."
"__MUSIC__ My favorite musical chord is a German Augmented Sixth."
"__MUSIC__ What is that? It sounds crazy."
"__MUSIC__ It contains scale degrees b3, #4, b6, and 1, with b6 usually in the bass."
"__MUSIC__ What makes it so special?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, b6 and #4 resolve to 5, making two chromatic voices approach the dominant by half-step, which is very strong."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds basic."
"__MUSIC__ No, it's not. It also can sound like a V7 (and thus a secondary dominant)  and can be used to modulate anywhere."
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea what that means or what you do."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, it means it's a fun chord that can do lots of different things."
"__MUSIC__ Got it."
"__MUSIC__ You really should study music more. It's a pretty simple concept."
"__MUSIC__ I took music appreciation but didn't really do any work and got a C."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sounds about right."
