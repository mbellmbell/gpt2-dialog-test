"__BASEBALL__ What did you think of that bat flip?"
"__BASEBALL__ Totally bush league."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you think that?"
"__BASEBALL__ It is one thing to get overly expressive when you are in a back and forth championship series and the tensions are high and you hit a dinger that sails; quite another when you are up 5 in the early part of the season."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree, he should act like he has been there before."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see what the pitcher said?"
"__BASEBALL__ No what did he say?"
"__BASEBALL__ He said he was pimping it and that we have seen it from him enough."
"__BASEBALL__ How much you want to bet he gets hit by pitch in next three or four games?"
"__BASEBALL__ He deserves it.  Most hated man in baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Pitchers stick up for each other.  I bet he gets hit."
"__BASEBALL__ I believe it could happen, but it could cause problems."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, his team sticks up for him."
"__BASEBALL__ So maybe we will see some bench clearing in the next couple of weeks."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe.  Or it could just die down."
"__BASEBALL__ Until he does it again."
"__BASEBALL__ He wouldn't!"
"__BASEBALL__ I would not bet against it.  He's pretty unsportsman like."
"__BASEBALL__ Eventually some one will hit him in the mouth again."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, because he just won't stop.  He thinks it is part of the game even though no one else does."
