"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, both teams are still good, but maybe they will start to take a backseat soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I just do not see that happening with Bill Belichek."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he is a great coach, but eventually they could wear down I guess, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, eventually, but they just seem too good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Brady has a cannon for an arm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he does, but they are built on more than just that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, do you actually think anybody could take them down this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I don't and especially not in their division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, Miami may complete this year, but not enough to take them down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. They have a good enough offense to complete, but they are not at the Patriots level yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree! Thats a much different level than they are on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, well not everyone can be the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about the Chiefs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh, they just haven't been able to get over the hump. Its kinda sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. Its tough, but thats Andy Reid for you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, he is a great coach, but he struggles when it means the most."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does and its unfortunate, but it seems to be the normal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, I agree. Maybe one day he will figure it out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, time is running out though, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, sorta, but he has a couple more years of coaching in him."
