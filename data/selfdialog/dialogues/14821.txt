"__ACTION__ Which is you favorite Lethal Weapon movie?"
"__ACTION__ I'd have to say Lethal Weapon 3."
"__ACTION__ Why's that?"
"__ACTION__ Because it has both Leo Getz, a Martin Riggs love interest just as tough as him, and Riggs in his fun kind of crazy persona."
"__ACTION__ Okay, but you have to admit Lethal Weapon 2 also had crazy fun Riggs."
"__ACTION__ True, ture, but then, after Reika's killed and he finds out the South African's killed his wife, he goes all death wish Martin Riggs again."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, but he's a little like than in number 3 as well."
"__ACTION__ When?"
"__ACTION__ When he has that crazy happy look on his face, as open's the door of the armored car, so he can wail on the driver."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, he defintely looks a little psycho when he does that."
