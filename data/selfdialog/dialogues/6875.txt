"__STAR_WARS__ Which droid from Star Wars is your favorite?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I personally love K-2SO from Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even more than R2-D2 and C-3PO?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know he's newer, and dead now, but K-2SO has the best personality."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about B-B8?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's cool too, and is probably my second favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd say B-B8 is my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm excited to see him in the new movie in December."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the trailer for that looks amazing!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I can't wait to see Luke Skywalker training Rey."
