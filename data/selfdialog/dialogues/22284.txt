"__DISNEY__ Hey, which Disney movies have you seen lately?"
"__DISNEY__ I actually just watched, 'Finding Dory' with my son."
"__DISNEY__ That was an awesome movie. I didn't think I'd like it because of it being a sequal."
"__DISNEY__ I get what you mean. Sequels usually aren't that good, but that one was awesome."
"__DISNEY__ Yes it was! I love how they gave the backstory on Dory. She was one of my favorite Disney characters."
"__DISNEY__ Me too! You have to love Ellen doing her voice."
"__DISNEY__ She was a perfect fit for her! Disney did a good job choosing her as the voice."
"__DISNEY__ What other Disney movies have you seen lately?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw Moana since Netflix has been streaming it."
"__DISNEY__ That movie is amazing. Such a great role model for girls."
