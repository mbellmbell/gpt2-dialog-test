"__STAR_WARS__ I just watched the original Star Wars last night.Did you ever see that one?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not the whole movie, just bits and pieces on T.V.."
"__STAR_WARS__ You should rent it. I think George Lucas had no clue what he was starting with that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ How old were you when that came out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was only eleven. It came out in 1977."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wow, that is an oldie. I saw one of the newer ones called The Clone Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw them all. That was good but you could tell Lucas had nothing to do with it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I would have to see them all to tell the difference. How many movies all together?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think there were at least ten movies. I could be wrong."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Force Awakens was supposed to be good too."
