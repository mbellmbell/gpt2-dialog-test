"__STAR_WARS__ It's so sad that Carrie Fisher died."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know.  And so soon after her mom died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you ever try the Princess Leia hairstyle?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm a dude.  My hair isn't long enough."
"__STAR_WARS__ Once I went to hear the symphony orchestra and the male cellist dressed as Princess Leia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?  How did he look."
"__STAR_WARS__ He went all out.  The full jabba the hut scene bikini, ear muffs and braids."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh my.  Was he good on the cello?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it was awesome.  The conductor dressed as Darth Vader and used a light saber as a baton."
"__STAR_WARS__ Man, I wish I could have seen that!"
