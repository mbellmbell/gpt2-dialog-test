"__MUSIC__ What was the first CD you ever owned?"
"__MUSIC__ Ace of Base. Don't laugh."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm laughing."
"__MUSIC__ C'mon, I was like 13 and 'I Saw the Sign' was a hit song."
"__MUSIC__ What else did your junior high self purchase?"
"__MUSIC__ The Smashing Pumpkins, Spin Doctors..."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, those two had some good songs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, and of course the Reality Bites Soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, man. I think everybody had that."
"__MUSIC__ The soundtrack may have been better than the movie."
"__MUSIC__ You can't go wrong with 'My Sharona'. Oh, and that Lisa Loeb song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my gosh, 'Stay'. I used to sing that all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. It always fascinated me that it had no chorus."
"__MUSIC__ I never even thought about that. It didn't, did it?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, which makes its hit status that much more significant."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the chorus is what's supposed to hook people."
"__MUSIC__ And Lisa Loeb was like, nah, I don't need that."
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame she never really had any more hits."
"__MUSIC__ I kind of want to go find that soundtrack now."
"__MUSIC__ Same. I may even look for my Ace of Base."
