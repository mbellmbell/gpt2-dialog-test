"__MOVIES__ Are you excited for the new Wonder Woman movie tomorrow?"
"__MOVIES__ Sort of."
"__MOVIES__ Why not ecstatic? You love superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'm honestly just not a big fan of DC comics adaptations."
"__MOVIES__ You're just sexist and can't handle a female superhero."
"__MOVIES__ That's not even remotely true."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I'm kidding."
"__MOVIES__ I'm interested, thought, because the reviews are outstanding."
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see it in the theaters or wait for redbox?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear about the women-only showing?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what's that?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a theater that's screening Wonder Woman just for women."
"__MOVIES__ No men are allowed?"
"__MOVIES__ Right."
"__MOVIES__ Now THAT'S sexist."
"__MOVIES__ True, but they deserve to do it."
"__MOVIES__ True, let women celebrate a woman superhero."
"__MOVIES__ Besides, it was probably just a handful of guys."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the news likes to blow things out of proportion."
