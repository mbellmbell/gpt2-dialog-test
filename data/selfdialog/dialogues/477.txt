"__MUSIC__ I think retiring was a stupid thing for Garth Brooks to do."
"__MUSIC__ Who is Garth Brooks?"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously."
"__MUSIC__ He used to be one of the biggest country music singers in the world."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that explains why I've never heard of him."
"__MUSIC__ You never listen to country music?"
"__MUSIC__ Not if I can help it."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever given it a chance?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. Why should I? It's all the same."
"__MUSIC__ You know, some country music has crossed over into pop?"
"__MUSIC__ And I probably don't listen to that either."
"__MUSIC__ Glad to see you have an open mind."
"__MUSIC__ Hey, country music is all about losing your love, losing your truck, missing your train."
"__MUSIC__ And you know this how? Considering you've never listened to it."
"__MUSIC__ Because that's what it's alway been about."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I see. So because that's what country was fifty years, that's what it will always be."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me I'm wrong."
"__MUSIC__ So, Country is all about trucks and trains? And rock is all about the Beatles and Motown, right?"
"__MUSIC__ No!"
