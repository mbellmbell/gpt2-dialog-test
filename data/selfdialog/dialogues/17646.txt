"__MOVIES__ Hey! I just got back from seeing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2."
"__MOVIES__ How was it? I saw it had an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was pretty good!"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it yet. I was afraid they'd take the Baby Groot thing too far."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, they handled it pretty well. Nowhere near Minions level of annoying or overdone."
"__MOVIES__ Good to hear. I've been getting burned out on Marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I didn't like the last Avengers movie much."
"__MOVIES__ Age of Ultron? I hated that movie."
"__MOVIES__ The first one was so good. The second one I think a lot of the characters felt 'off'."
"__MOVIES__ I really wish they'd consider taking more of a break between films."
"__MOVIES__ There's at least 8 more Marvel films planned by 2019. Including two more Avengers films."
"__MOVIES__ Everything seems like it's becoming a 'cinematic universe' thing now."
"__MOVIES__ Mostly just Marvel and Star Wars, but they're releasing so many films between them that it does feel overdone."
"__MOVIES__ The only one I am really looking forward to is the rumored Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars film."
"__MOVIES__ If they got Ewan McGregor back to play Obi-Wan, I would watch that film in a heartbeat!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know it's rumored he's going to play as Christopher Robin in a live-action Pooh movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No kidding?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, movie called Christopher Robin. No release date or much known yet."
"__MOVIES__ I really liked watching him in Blackhawk Down."
"__MOVIES__ He was in Moulin Rouge as well. More movies need Ewan McGregor!"
