"__BASEBALL__ Hey, you been following baseball this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I have a bit. I think the weirdest story was Madison Bumgarner on the Giants getting injured in a dirtbike accident."
"__BASEBALL__ Agreed, he's being paid millions of dollars to stay healthy and perform physically. Kind of an idiotic move."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, totally irresponsible, but they can't really punish him because they need him to be happy with the organization."
"__BASEBALL__ You think the Cubs will repeat this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Haha, nobody has been able to ask that question for 100 years."
"__BASEBALL__ Good point. I think they have as good a shot as anyone."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, the playoffs are always a toss-up, but if they get there they will be in good shape with their pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they probably have the best rotation in the league."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see that 18 inning game the other night between them and the Yankees?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, it ended way after my bedtime. The Yankees are surprisingly good this year."
"__BASEBALL__ I think I actually like some of their players now that A-Rod is gone. I don't have to root against them."
"__BASEBALL__ They're still the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Haha, true. Their fans can be a bit much."
"__BASEBALL__ You been to any games yet?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not yet, I'll definitely see a few once the weather warms up."
"__BASEBALL__ Totally, I love day games in the summer. Nothing better than a sunny afternoon and baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it's one of those things that's as enjoyable as when I was a little kid."
"__BASEBALL__ It really never gets old. There's some magic to the ballpark."
"__BASEBALL__ Let me know when you plan to go, I'd love to get some sun and see some ball."
