"__MUSIC__ Do you like Jazz Music?"
"__MUSIC__ It is not my go to genre but I don't mind listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ It is sad that not much Jazz music is written today or at least charted."
"__MUSIC__ I agree and also a lot of the music today sounds to simmilar. I wish we could see Jazz and other genres on the charts again."
"__MUSIC__ Yes the charts are mostly dominated by hip hop and pop these days."
"__MUSIC__ I don't mind hip hop and pop but those genres didn't really exist 50 years ago and the world was fine."
"__MUSIC__ I know I wish people would realize that and see there is so much more to music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it does not have to be as basic as some of the songs on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ There is far to much recycling and borrowing going on. I don't like when artists essentialy reuse the beats of other artists."
