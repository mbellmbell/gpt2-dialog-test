"__ACTION__ Have you seen any foreign action movies?"
"__ACTION__ I've seen The Raid: Redemption."
"__ACTION__ Oh, that is a great action movie."
"__ACTION__ It is the action movie I've always wanted."
"__ACTION__ Why is that?"
"__ACTION__ I've always wanted an action movie with the most minimal amount of plot in favor of being almost nothing but action sequences."
"__ACTION__ That makes sense. Usually the plot is nothing special in action movies anyways."
"__ACTION__ Exactly, and all we want to see are cool action set pieces."
"__ACTION__ Yeah and that movie has nothing but cool action set pieces."
"__ACTION__ My personal favorite was the scene where the two brothers are fighting Mad Dog."
