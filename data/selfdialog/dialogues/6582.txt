"__STAR_WARS__ So what do you think of the legacy of Princess Leia as a sci-fi movie character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I think we tend to forget how novel she was in the first film from 1977."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, the idea that she is a princess they need to rescue, but she also knows how to fight the bad guys!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course. A very strong female character and not someone who sits around helpless for the whole movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, not at all. And as someone who gets to watch her home planet destroyed, you feel her pain."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and understand what drives her to fight to stop the Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ She loses so much in that first movie, and it's really dark when you see it from her perspective."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't forget, Darth Vader tortures her, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, that's right. And men always talk about how great she looks in that gold bikini in Return of the Jedi, but..."
"__STAR_WARS__ She chokes Jabba the Hutt to death! Definitely a strong heroine."
