"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, let's talk football. You're a Colts fan, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, born and raised."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about the latest Peyton scandal?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean about how they might have used hearing aids twenty years ago?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the one. It's against the rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That depends largely on whether they were electronic or not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, you don't think they cheated?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I'm sure the Colts cheat as much as any other team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the Pats just get caught cheating more often."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's because they are winners. Nobody cares if losers cheat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How true. If you cheat and still lose..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, the season they are talking about with Peyton was not a great one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has had several scandals now, though. The HGH 'for his wife's, the sexual assault in college, the hearing aids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and now we have Brady's concussion scandal, as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that is an important one. The players shouldn't be playing with concussions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but it's also their brains to make that decision. They ought to know the consequences."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the power of the culture. Winning is everything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Until they retire and lose the ability to walk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The smart ones get in and make some money and leave before they get too beat up."
