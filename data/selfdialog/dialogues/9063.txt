"__BASEBALL__ Did you watch the game last night?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, did it play on TV?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I thought you knew?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, I hadn't realized.  Who won?"
"__BASEBALL__ We did, of course."
"__BASEBALL__ Awesome.  What was the score?"
"__BASEBALL__ 7-5."
"__BASEBALL__ Really?  That's a lot of runs."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, pitching sucked on both sides."
"__BASEBALL__ It sounds like it."
"__BASEBALL__ Plus each side had two errors."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow.  Where there any actual good hits are was it just bad defense?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, we had a few doubles, but really nothing."
"__BASEBALL__ That's crazy.  They don't even have a good pitching staff."
"__BASEBALL__ I know.  We struck out seven times."
"__BASEBALL__ Really?  That's pretty embarrassing."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I'm sure they'll be spending some time in the batting cages after last night."
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds like they need time practicing pitching too."
"__BASEBALL__ The whole team needs practice."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe we won."
