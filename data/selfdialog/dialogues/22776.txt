"__DISNEY__ I know Disney is known for its happy themes, but there are surprisingly disturbing moments."
"__DISNEY__ You're right.  Which one is most disturbing for you?"
"__DISNEY__ I remember there was the Stegosaurus that was killed explicitly by a T-Rex in 'Fantasia.'"
"__DISNEY__ I know that scene.  That one was really disturbing to me too when I first saw it."
"__DISNEY__ Do you have a particular one that comes to mind?"
"__DISNEY__ For me, it was when Scar kills Mufasa."
"__DISNEY__ The fact that Mufasa was trampled by a herd was too graphic for me as a child."
"__DISNEY__ It still makes me really sad to this day."
"__DISNEY__ As sad as many of these scenes are, I think they add depth to these movies."
"__DISNEY__ True, they are stronger movies for them."
