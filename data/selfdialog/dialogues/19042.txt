"__MOVIES__ Hey Joey!"
"__MOVIES__ Tony! Hey!"
"__MOVIES__ What's up?"
"__MOVIES__ Not a thing. You?"
"__MOVIES__ I got some stuff going."
"__MOVIES__ You got stuff going?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I got stuff going. What do you care?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I like you, Joey. Too simple to care..."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks, but I thought you liked me because I look like that guy from the movie, 'The 300.' You know, the one with all the Abs."
"__MOVIES__ That is exactly why I like you, Joey. Because you look like the actor, Gerard Butler, who played 'Leonidas' in the movie, 'The 300.'"
"__MOVIES__ That's what I thought."
"__MOVIES__ But I don't think you quite got it yet. I do think of you when I see Gerard Butler, but it's not because of the movie, 'The 300.'"
"__MOVIES__ It's not?"
"__MOVIES__ No. It's not."
"__MOVIES__ Then what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's another movie. You remind me of that guy, but in another movie."
"__MOVIES__ What movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Phantom of the Opera."
"__MOVIES__ Phantom of the Opera? But you never seen me in a cape."
