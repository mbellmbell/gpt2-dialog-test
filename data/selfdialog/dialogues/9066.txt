"__BASEBALL__ the Cleveland Indians are really spinning their wheels so far"
"__BASEBALL__ yeah really, tell me about it"
"__BASEBALL__ it's like, one day the pitching is good..."
"__BASEBALL__ but not the hitting, and then the next day they give up a bunch of runs and can't hit!"
"__BASEBALL__ exactly, it's frustrating!"
"__BASEBALL__ the bullpen has been tough though"
"__BASEBALL__ yeah, I think Tito will figure it out going into June"
"__BASEBALL__ injuries are starting to pile up though"
"__BASEBALL__ yes, but they're pretty deep still"
"__BASEBALL__ especially the pitchers"
"__BASEBALL__ yep. how do you think they'll finish up?"
"__BASEBALL__ well, nobody in the central is really good either, so probably they'll win the division at least"
"__BASEBALL__ then it'll all come down to winning playoff series"
"__BASEBALL__ and now they're battle tested"
"__BASEBALL__ do you think they can win the AL?"
"__BASEBALL__ yes, but that's not the question..."
"__BASEBALL__ yeah, I know, the question is 'can they beat the cubs'?"
"__BASEBALL__ exactly"
"__BASEBALL__ and?"
"__BASEBALL__ they better. :-)"
