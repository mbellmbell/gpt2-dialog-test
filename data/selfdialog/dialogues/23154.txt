"__DISNEY__ What do you think about the new Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Like, does it compare to the original? I'm not sure."
"__DISNEY__ I think it's got its own appeal. But the animated one will always be classic."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I think I still know all the words to the songs!"
"__DISNEY__ I definitely know all the words. Who can forget them?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, when Belle is dancing with the Beast and Mrs. Potts is singing."
"__DISNEY__ Just thinking about it makes me feel nostalgic."
"__DISNEY__ I should see the new one! Just to see if it compares."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, go see it and let me know what you think."
"__DISNEY__ Will do!"
