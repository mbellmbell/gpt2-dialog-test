"__BASEBALL__ Baseball of course!"
"__BASEBALL__ It's always good to go out and see a game, what's your favorite team?"
"__BASEBALL__ Probably the KC royals."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah? They were champions in what, 2015?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. They did really well that year. The year of the MOOSE!"
"__BASEBALL__ Haha, yeah. All the chanting."
"__BASEBALL__ They haven't done as great, but they are still a solid team."
"__BASEBALL__ And really, staying loyal is what keeps teams like that solid."
"__BASEBALL__ True, not every year is going to be a championship."
"__BASEBALL__ Speaking of which, seems the curse is broken on the Cubs!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah go Chicago! That was so close!"
"__BASEBALL__ That was intense, really. Indians were so close to taking it home."
"__BASEBALL__ Cubs really deserved it though. Over a century and there it was."
"__BASEBALL__ I've a friend that is an Indian's fan, and she was not pleased in the least."
