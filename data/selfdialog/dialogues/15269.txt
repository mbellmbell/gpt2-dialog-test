"__HARRY_POTTER__ How many Harry Potter movies are there?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It depends on how you count them, though eight is probably the answer."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Weren't there seven books?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There were, but the last book, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' was divided in to two parts."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Were the same actors used throughout the movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Mostly they were, but there were a few exceptions.  Dumbledore and one of Draco's henchmen changed."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why did they change?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The role of Dumbledore was played by both Richard Harris and Michael Gambon due to death."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Anyone else change?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Lavender Brown did, she was only a minor character in the first couple, so it wasn't that important in the first couple because she didn't really have speaking roles, but when the later books came out and she became more important they changed her actress for the later movies."
