"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know what I think is needed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? I can't wait for this one"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A new scoring play"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Um... What?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A new scoring play. We score how? a field goal or a TD right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a safety, and a fair catch kick, oh, and a PAT, but yes. What about?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes those too, but we need to allow the QB to throw the ball into the goal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That' the dumbest idea ever. There is no way NFL owners will go for that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not with that kind of attitude."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not with any kind of attitude, besides, just about all the QBs would be able to make that probably from 100 yards away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We can make it difficult by putting a net in front of the goal so that you have to throw it into a designated area with a hole in it to go through"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's even dumber that just pitching it into the goal!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why are you so negative?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am realistic. Not negative."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's a great idea. it shoul dbe worth 5 points, so if you're down by 5 points after your team makes the FG, then you tie the game and go to overtime"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, wait, what? No... There is no way more overtime is welcomed in the NFL. Guys are too old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it makes for a better entertainment"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But entertainment isn't the issue, players need to rest. They're in their late 20s and 30s. They can't play for overtime constantly. That's why we have sudden death"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sudden death is the dumbest idea ever. They should abolish that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't even know what to tell you."
