"__MUSIC__ Whats your favorite type of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Man, I really miss late 90's early 200's ghetto rap."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I grew up with it, and today's version of rap is terrible. Have you heard this new stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, I kind of like it."
"__MUSIC__ Eww why? It sounds like they are mumbling and I can't understand anything."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but I also think it's a new style and we should have open minds."
"__MUSIC__ I did have an open mind, Lil Wayne shut it."
"__MUSIC__ How can you blame this on him?"
"__MUSIC__ He was the one who started this mumble rap genre."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember his first hit song?"
"__MUSIC__ I remember Go DJ."
"__MUSIC__ Fine. Does that sound like anything he does now?"
"__MUSIC__ Well no, but styles change and adapt."
"__MUSIC__ Why did it change though?"
"__MUSIC__ Because the whole game was changing at the time, so he adjusted to it."
"__MUSIC__ Nope. Try again."
"__MUSIC__ Just tell me why then."
"__MUSIC__ He started using Promathazine and his speech slurred because of it. That's why we have mumble rap now, it's not talent."
