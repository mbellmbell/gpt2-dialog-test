"__MOVIES__ I watched Secret Killer last night. What a great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about hunting a killer in a red cape who's killing American tourists and cutting out their eyes."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like an Umberto Lenzi giallo I saw called called Eyeball."
"__MOVIES__ Lenzi directed this one too. Maybe it's the same movie."
"__MOVIES__ It is, I just looked it up. Just an alternate title."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was good! I've seen a few of Lenzi's films."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see So Sweet and So Perverse?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, with Carrol Baker from Baby Doll!"
"__MOVIES__ I like her too. She was in a few other Lenzi movies."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What else?"
"__MOVIES__ Knife of Ice and Quiet Place to Kill, and one or two more I think."
"__MOVIES__ She was cute!"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, a real babydoll!"
"__MOVIES__ Ahuh! Funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you see her in Harlow?"
"__MOVIES__ Harlow? I don't think so."
"__MOVIES__ She played Jean Harlow. It was like a docudrama about her life."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like something I might like."
