"__MOVIES__ Did you watch the Final Destination movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I had watched just the first two."
"__MOVIES__ Why only the first two?"
"__MOVIES__ It just got old and gory."
"__MOVIES__ Why was it old?  I thought they were exciting."
"__MOVIES__ You knew what was going to happen in everyone."
"__MOVIES__ Not really."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, well you knew who was going to die."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're right on that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, what's the fun if you know that everyone will die?"
"__MOVIES__ You didn't know how though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's where the gore came in."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah.  They were gory for sure."
"__MOVIES__ So many freak accidents."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everyone was getting decapitated."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, just gory and overkill."
"__MOVIES__ Was that a pun?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't mean it to be."
"__MOVIES__ So you didn't see the one at the race track?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so.  Wasn't that the third or fourth one?"
