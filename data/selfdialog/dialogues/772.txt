"__MUSIC__ I don't really know what to make of Bluegrass."
"__MUSIC__ That's an odd statement. What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well it's country except it's not, except when it is."
"__MUSIC__ Not less confusing. How is it country?"
"__MUSIC__ Come on. It has banjos in it!"
"__MUSIC__ Ok but a banjo does not a country song make."
"__MUSIC__ Ok fine, but it also has fiddles. Not violins, but fiddles!"
"__MUSIC__ Listen, bluegrass and country kind of come from the same place but they're different in a lot of ways."
"__MUSIC__ Like how?"
"__MUSIC__ Bluegrass is wild. Think about how smooth and mellow a lot of country singers' voices are."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they do have beautiful voices."
"__MUSIC__ Now listen to the lead singer in a bluegrass band. That voice is almost always really twangy."
"__MUSIC__ Like a banjo!"
"__MUSIC__ Will you lay off the banjos?"
"__MUSIC__ Ok fine, so the singing style is different."
"__MUSIC__ The singing style and the musical style itself. Have you listened to much celtic music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but we're talking about Bluegrass and Country here."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's the thing. Bluegrass music, a lot of it, is more like Celtic than Country."
"__MUSIC__ You think so?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like dance music, reels and jigs and things. That's the root of bluegrass and it's what makes it different."
