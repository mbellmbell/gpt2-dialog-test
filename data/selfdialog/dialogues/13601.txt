"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey there, excited about the Cowboys chances for next season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You bet! Would have loved keeping Romo on the bench for insurance since you saw him step in at the end of the season last year and make a TD, but whatever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak and Zeke are amazing, but makes you think they won't flake out in their sophmore year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Prescott has the maturity to keep going--he's already shown his leadership with the old guys. I just hope Elliott doesn't get himself hurt with all his gymnastics!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Zeke's on fire! He's fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he sure does light a spark under that offense and makes those veteran look life-like again!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now if they could only pull it off during post-season--it sucks only getting there and then never winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know what it is about the post-season. Even with a bye week they still managed to come in and screw it up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just can't play more than 16 games a year, I guess!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know if it's coaching or what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same thing happens every time they get there since.... I don't know... Coach Switzer? Back in the mid 90s??"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I blame Jerry Jones. I know he got us three rings but it seems like he cost the team a lot of integrity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think people want--Super Bowls or integrity? I bet I know..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Truth... it's about the money. Not like when Tex Schramm and Landry ran the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nah, still about money, just in a different way. Stop being so idealistic! Remember all the guys that had the team after Schramm sold it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd just like to see my 'Boys win and stop getting into trouble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ ... and Jerry Jones keep out of coaching and player business and just stay up in the owner's suite where he frickin' belongs!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here here!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Makes me want to go down to the new stadium in Arlington and pay some exorbitant price for a ticket!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not so new! But, then again, I last saw them was in the 'old' stadium in Irving, and they had been there since before I was born!"
