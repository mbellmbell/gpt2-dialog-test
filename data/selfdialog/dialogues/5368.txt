"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever seen Red Letter Media?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know think so.. what's it about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's this guy who does reviews on Youtube.  One of the things he's most famous for it this several of his Star Wars movie reviews, including the Phantom Menace."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I haven't."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, man, it is HILARIOUS!  I mean, he doesn't just nitpick things, but he offers a lot of really wise insight while pretending to be this deranged old guy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, man, it's sounds pretty funny."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is.  You'll have to look it up.  I mean, he points out things like, there's no real protagonist in the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Uh.. isn't that Anakin?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, not really.  I mean, he doesn't show up until about the middle of the film, and pretty much affects the story only by accident."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, yeah, I remember that.  He just hits a few buttons and the ship takes off on it's own."
