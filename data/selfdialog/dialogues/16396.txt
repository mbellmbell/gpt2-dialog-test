"__ROCK__ What are your thoughts on Counting Crows?"
"__ROCK__ Counting Crows?  Man, that takes me back."
"__ROCK__ Are they even making music anymore?"
"__ROCK__ Beats me.  I don't think I can really remember any songs from them in the past 15 years."
"__ROCK__ Did you know the lead singer once dated Jennifer Aniston?"
"__ROCK__ Seriously?  That dude had dreads even."
"__ROCK__ I know, crazy right?  If I were dating her, I wouldn't stop dating her."
"__ROCK__ Well, when you're popular like they were, you were actually more well-known then her too."
"__ROCK__ I'll have to see if they have anything recent."
"__ROCK__ Yeah, give it a spin and let me know."
