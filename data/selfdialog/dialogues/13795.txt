"__BASKETBALL__ Do you think the NBA should do away with a salary cap?"

"__BASKETBALL__ Teams would just join up together?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah it creates a balance that you need in the league."
"__BASKETBALL__ I can see the problem being that teams would try to skip on salaries."

"__BASKETBALL__ I would rather see super teams to be honest"
"__BASKETBALL__ Baseball doesnt have the problem"
