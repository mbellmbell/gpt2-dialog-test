"__BEATLES__ So, my husband doesn't like the Beatles!"
"__BEATLES__ What? How is that possible?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know, I think he says it just to get me going.  He knows I love the Beatles, especially John."
"__BEATLES__ I prefer Paul, but together they wrote some amazing songs."
"__BEATLES__ I agree, I enjoy tribute bands, but I really wish that they were all still alive so they could do a reunion tour."
"__BEATLES__ That would be AMAZING!!  If they would even do that, they stopped touring early in their career."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, that's right.  I remember hearing that."
"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ That is a tough question, I love the well known ones, but Rocky Racoon always make me smile!"
"__BEATLES__ Oh yes, that one is good.  I think Something is my favorite, but then I will hear Eleanor Rigby, and that could be my favorite."
