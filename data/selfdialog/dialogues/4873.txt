"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with the concept of a desert island disc?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. Does it mean the record that you'd take with you if you were stuck on a desert island and would potentially have to listen to it forever."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's exactly it. A strange hypothetical that I don't think has happened to anyone ever, but a fun one nonetheless."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, so what's your desert island pick?"
"__MUSIC__ I would take The White Album by The Beatles. It's all over the place emotionally, musically, and collaboratively."
"__MUSIC__ I like that pick, but there is too much on that album that I simply don't like."
"__MUSIC__ What would you pick then?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a super tough question. I'm afraid I don't have an answer off the top of my head."
"__MUSIC__ Quick the plane is falling and you get to choose just one disc."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, okay, okay. Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, what a beautiful record."
"__MUSIC__ I can see 'I Know There's an Answer' being a song of hope for you."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. The album is the perfect amount of poppy, mixed with orchestral, mixed with experimental, and there is such a genuine feeling about it."
"__MUSIC__ If you had to pull one song off that record what would it be?"
"__MUSIC__ That's tough. Probably Let's Go Away for A While."
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm. That's an instrumental song, wouldn't you maybe want one instrumental song on a desert island?"
"__MUSIC__ Good point. This makes it very tough."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, again I say, plane is falling, you gotta pick one song to go or you don't get any of them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I just realized Pet Sounds is also an instrumental track. The eponymous song, I'd drop that one, Pet Sounds, it's not as good as Let's Go Away for A While."
"__MUSIC__ A considerably easier task, but I still will ask: What would you drop from the White Album?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably No. 9. I think the avant garde sound collage aspect of it would make me go crazy."
