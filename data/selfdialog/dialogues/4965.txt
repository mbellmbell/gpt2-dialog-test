"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Can we talk about the trucker from the original The Fast and The Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What about that trucker?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, he's the only guy who's been able to battle off Dom. If you think about everything Dom's been able to accomplish throughout the whole series, the Trucker was the only one to have successfully foil his plans."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's funny. I never thought about that but you're right. That trucker was prepared, with his shotgun, and he was so calm during the whole truck heist."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Seriously, that trucker is legendary. He must be sitting at home watching the events from all the other Fast and Furious movies and laughing to himself about how he stood up to Dom."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's amazing really, he was on his own in that truck and I think he took out Vince, and nearly got Dom too."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Dom never really talks about this incident."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You can safely say that Dom probably erased it from his mind like it never happened."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The trucker needs to make a return in the next Fast and Furious as the ultimate nemesis."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I would die from laughter if that happened. I can see him teaming up with Charlize's character, Cyper, to exact revenge on Dom's team."
