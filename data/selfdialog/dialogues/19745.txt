"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it, but I didn't care for it a whole lot."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I thought you liked animated movies, that's why I asked."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, I often like animated movies, but that one was weird. I did like the second one much better."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ The second one had the foodimals, or whatever they called the food that turned into animals."
"__MOVIES__ And you thought the first one was weird?"
"__MOVIES__ I know, but it had more heart to it in the second movie. Plus, I saw it in 3D."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you saw it in 3D? That must be what did it."
"__MOVIES__ Not really. It made it more interesting, but the story was better too."
"__MOVIES__ So I'm thinking, what's weirder, food raining from the sky, or food turning into animals?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, forget I said the first one was weird. Maybe I just got used to the idea by the time the second one came out."
"__MOVIES__ Whatever. So you did like the second one then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. It was cute. Your kids would like it."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure they would. I was wondering if I would be able to watch it with them."
"__MOVIES__ Sure you can, it's enjoyable for adults too."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. Maybe I can get it for the family to watch together."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good, then you can tell me what you thought of it."
"__MOVIES__ I'll do that, and I'll tell you what my kids thought of it too."
"__MOVIES__ All right. I'll look forward to finding out."
