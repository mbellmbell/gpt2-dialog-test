"__HORROR__ Do you know if the movie Abattoir is good?"
"__HORROR__ It is interesting but not for everyone. Do you like the work of Darren Bousman?"
"__HORROR__ I liked the first Saw. What else did he do?"
"__HORROR__ He did the cult horror-musical Repo! The Genetic Opera."
"__HORROR__ I did not like that one. Is Abattoir more like Saw, or more like Repo?"
"__HORROR__ It's really like neither but also like both. It is stylized like Repo!, but has a mystery and production value closer to Saw."
"__HORROR__ What do you mean when you say Abattoir is stylized?"
"__HORROR__ It is in the neo-noir genre, and the lead actress, Jessica Lowndes, has this sort of 50s pin-up style. It was so noir at times that I thought it was set in the 40s or 50s."
"__HORROR__ Is it in black and white?"
"__HORROR__ No, it just uses the aesthetic of noir. The colors are actually very striking."
