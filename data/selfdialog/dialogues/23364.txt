"__DISNEY__ I was humming that song to 'The Lion King' this morning."
"__DISNEY__ Which one?  Hakuna matata?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, it got stuck in my head while driving."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good movie we should watch it later."
"__DISNEY__ Yes it has been years since I saw it."
"__DISNEY__ I had a plush toy 'Simba' when I was growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Me too!  I watched that movie so many times - my copy wore out."
"__DISNEY__ I know, I had a poster of Jonathon Taylor Thomas on my wall!"
"__DISNEY__ Oh right.  He played Simba."
"__DISNEY__ Ya, I had a huge crush on him."
