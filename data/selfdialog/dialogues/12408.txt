"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL is getting close to kicking off another season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I am really excited about that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I figured you would be. Which teams will you be following this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know me, I follow the entire league!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A couple friends of mine from work were discussing the NFL the other day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? What were they discussing about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were having a debate about who the best cornerback of all time was."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish I could have been part of that discussion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought about you when I heard them talking about it!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who were they saying the best cornerbacks of all time were?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One of them said Darrell Green was the best he had ever seen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember Green, he was fantastic as a corner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The other one was sure that Champ Bailey was the best ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bailey was great as well, I even followed him in college when he played for Georgia."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you think it was? Bailey or Green?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Neither! Those two friends of yours must have been forgetting about someone who was really the best corner of all time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They both seemed pretty sure of themselves. Who do you think they were forgetting?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The best corner of all time was hands down Deion Sanders!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember watching him myself! Did he have some type of nick name?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, his nickname was Prime Time! He was the best to ever do it!"
