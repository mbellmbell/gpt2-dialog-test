"__STAR_WARS__ What are you talking about?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm talking about Star Wars."

"__STAR_WARS__ The ones after that are supposed to tell the story of what led up to those three."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who starts a movie or a story backwards?"
"__STAR_WARS__ They made them movies just to make money off the franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like The Empire Strikes Back, it had a lot of action with Luke and Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too. I had a feeling all along that Darth Vader was Luke's father."
