"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why were the Bears so bad last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they had a ton of injuries on defense to start with."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. They lost Danny Trevathon and Pernell McFee and those guys were suposed to be the heart of the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget that they lost Leonard Floyd to concussions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Floyd. Did you see his interview about how he dealt with the concussions over the off season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, how did he manage to recuperate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think he did, actually. He said that he just sat in his room on his sofa and stared at the TV all day because he couldn't get up to do anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, I never have experienced a concussion, so I have no idea how severe the recovery time is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The scary thing is that research is showing that it's not the big hits that are causing the big damage, but rather the repetitive non-concussive trauma."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean all the regular hits that lineman take on every play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, these repetitive hits accumulate over a lifetime to produce serious damage to the brain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, by the time these kids make it to the NFL, they've played and practiced hundreds if not thousands of hits already."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That really is scary. I kind of feel guilty enjoying a game where these guys are permanently hurting themselves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. I love a good hit as much as the next guy, but the reality is that this is a very violent sport."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What can they do to address the concussion issue?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they have been expanding the 'concussion protocol' where a doctor is required to be on the field and able to administer a battery of tests to a potentially concussed player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I meant: will they change the game so that there are less hits during gameplay?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. I think that they changed the kick-off distance for exactly that reason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I played football all the way through high school, but I don't think I want my sons playing when they get older."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, With this concussion issue gathering more data about health implications, there's no way I will let my kids play football, unfortunately."
