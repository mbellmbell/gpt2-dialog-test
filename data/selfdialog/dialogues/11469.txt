"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Soon enough the 2017 NFL season will start!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to get a jump on it and go down to Mankato for the Vikings training camp?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never thought about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You should, I'm not even a fan but I hear it's fun."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know anyone who has gone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I have a friend who goes every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does he like it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Tickets are so expensive now that the only way to see the players play for free is at training camp."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Plus, you can get close enough to ask for a selfie or autograph."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now I have to go!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he takes his nephew and the neighbor kid along so they can see their favorite players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are they big NFL fans?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, Of course they both want to be professional football players when they grow up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did I."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course they won't make it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You never know. Remember you know some pro players since you were young before they made it and you didn't think they would make it either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Even after they made it I look back to when they were saying one day they'd be pro football players and I STILL don't think they'll make it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So cynical."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I am."
