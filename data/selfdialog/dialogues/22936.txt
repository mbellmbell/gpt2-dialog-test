"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite Disney cartoon growing up?"
"__DISNEY__ I really liked their animated version of Robin Hood."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think I had seen that one."
"__DISNEY__ It's older.  I think it was from the seventies."
"__DISNEY__ Did it follow the Robin Hood story line?"
"__DISNEY__ Pretty much, except the characters were animals.  Robin Hood was a fox."
"__DISNEY__ Was it good?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh, we had it on VHS and we watched it like every week."
"__DISNEY__ So it really was one of your favorites."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I'm surprised you'd never seen it."
