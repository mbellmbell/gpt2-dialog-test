"__ACTION__ You have see this movie called Suburban Commando."
"__ACTION__ I've never heard of it. What's it about?"
"__ACTION__ Oh it's great. Basically it is Hulk Hogan as an alien assassin being chased by other alien assassins who are also professional wrestlers."
"__ACTION__ This is starting to sound like a terrible movie."
"__ACTION__ It is! But it is just so terrible that it happened to be great. They obviously blew their budget on the Hulkster."
"__ACTION__ Okay, so you are saying it's kind of like Sharknado, in that it's so bad that it's kind of good?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I mean just imagine Hulk Hogan in a cheap alien uniform escaping the Undertaker's lasers through a random suburban town."
"__ACTION__ Oh god, I don't know if I want to see this movie."
"__ACTION__ It is so worth it though. The entire movie is cheap, the frame rate is even something like three frames per second because they run out of money."
"__ACTION__ That just sounds despicable."
