"__DISNEY__ Do you remember watching Lilo & Stitch as a kid?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! It made me want to go to Hawaii!"
"__DISNEY__ It made me want to have a cute pet alien."
"__DISNEY__ Stitch was so destructive, though!"
"__DISNEY__ I know, but it would be worth it for how cute he was."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure about that... Maybe I'd like to have him around once he's settled down a lot."
"__DISNEY__ I liked how Lilo fed that fish a sandwich all the time."
"__DISNEY__ And she couldn't feed him a tuna sandwich!"
"__DISNEY__ Of course, it did make her late to her dance class."
"__DISNEY__ I think she ended up better once she got her destructive alien friend after all."
