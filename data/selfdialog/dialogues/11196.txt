"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, who won Super Bowl IV?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be the Kansas City Chiefs"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really, I didn't realize they won a Super Bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's when Hank Stram was their coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, the coach that always wore those blazers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's the one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you remember who they played?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was the Minnesota Vikings"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really, I didn't realize the Vikings have been to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they've been, but never won."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where did they play it back then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe it was in New Orleans"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Super Dome?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, they didn't have the dome back then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Must've been an outdoor stadium then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can't remember where though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the Chiefs haven't done much since then"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really. Always close, but never a clincher"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, tough for the fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they have one."
