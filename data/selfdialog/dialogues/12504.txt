"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate this down time we are in for sports right now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know what you mean,unless you are a baseball fan it really stinks at the moment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least we don't have to wait to much longer and the NFL will be here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what I keep telling myself!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think we will be the best teams this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel that the Patriots and Cowboys will be the teams to beat this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys? They have not sniffed the Superbowl in years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That does not mean they can't get to it this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So is that your Superbowl prediction then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, It will be the Dallas Cowboys vs the New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am going to record you saying that so you can not deny it later on in the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am pretty confident in that pick actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The patriots I can understand; but not the Cowboys!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do not see why, they are actually a very talented team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith are not walking through that door!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be in the Superbowl this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it will be the Pitsburgh Steelers taking on the Green Bay Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like that prediction; although I do not think the Steelers will be all that great this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are a consistent franchise and I respect that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will see which one of us has the better predictions when the season rolls around!"
