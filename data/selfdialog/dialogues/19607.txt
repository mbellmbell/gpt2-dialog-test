"__MOVIES__ Hey - Have you watched the new screener for the remake of IT?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh my - yes! It was a crazy screener and I'm so excited for that remake."
"__MOVIES__ If they were going to remake any movie from the early 1990s that I was actually excited about, that would be it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah - there are a lot that are good, but it seems like the thrill of horror movies allows them to be remade without really impacting the theme as much."
"__MOVIES__ It's almost like if you took a romance or comedy movie out of the 90s and tried to remake it, it would lose a lot of its charm."
"__MOVIES__ That's for sure. I really wish they would make more Steven King movies now anyways"
"__MOVIES__ Yes - I don't know why they keep coming up with bad action movies when a great horror movie would be appreciated."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any other new movies you're excited to see?"
"__MOVIES__ Dark Knight seems really good, but I'm not sure that I really want to see it."
"__MOVIES__ That's a tough topic that they went with on that one, which seems to not be the case with most movies nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ I am kind of excited to see the Transformers franchise come to an end"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it seems like they have a new one of those every few months and I didn't like the old ones that much, so it's just annoying to me to have to keep seeing new ones."
"__MOVIES__ The one genre I think is really succeeding is the animation genre."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah - there is really no competing. Back in the day, it would take forever to come up with one movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know - It's like Disney would release something every 5 to 10 years, but now they can come out with a story that's just as good and memorable nearly every year."
"__MOVIES__ Pixar seemed to really force everyone to step up their game."
"__MOVIES__ They were definitely the cause of most of the transition with digital animation, but you have to realize that their 'focus on the characters and storyline' comes from Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe it's me being biased, but it seems like the new movies are not as memorable as the ones from years past."
"__MOVIES__ They are pushing a lot of garbage out and maybe that's been weeded out of our memories from time, but there doesn't seem to be that many straight up horrible movies from decades past."
"__MOVIES__ I agree completely."
