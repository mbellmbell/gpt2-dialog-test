"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, are you a Chicago Bears fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, my family is from Chicago"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of their moves this offseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a little bit puzzled by them signing a QB and then trading up to draft Trubisky with the third pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, it almost seems like their GM didn't plan things out very well"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I'm glad they got rid of Jay Cutler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure, Cutler has been a burden on the team for years now"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I liked him at first but the more he played and the more I saw him throw intercepts and then pout on the sidelines the more I knew he wasn't the guy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As Greenbay Packer fan I felt the exact opposite when I saw him throw a pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Packers will be this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm expecting a season similar to last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they improved over the offseason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibly, I think their running game will be better but their defense will be about the same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So that means their defense will be bad right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I know Bear's fans have seen lots of examples of bad defense the last few seasons, but I don't think it will too bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey! The Bear's defense wasn't that bad last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only bad enough to net the Bears a top five draft pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can't blame that all on the defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But you can't say that the defense was very good either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a fair statement."
