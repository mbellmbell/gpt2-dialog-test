"__BASEBALL__ How about those Astros?"
"__BASEBALL__ I know, first place! I can't believe it!"
"__BASEBALL__ Those young guys finally playing well."
"__BASEBALL__ I agree, Correa, Springer, Altuve."
"__BASEBALL__ It's a really bright future."
"__BASEBALL__ The manager finally seems to have control of the team too."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the Veterans added to the team help a lot."
"__BASEBALL__ Certainly, you can't overlook the veteran players added to the team."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they will go all the way?"
"__BASEBALL__ It's impossible to predict, I'd just enjoy it while it lasts."
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely, not every day you get to support a first place team."
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly, they certainly have the talent to continue winning games."
"__BASEBALL__ Did you see them play the Yankees?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I was surprise with how much better they proved to be."
"__BASEBALL__ You know what could stop them? A trade."
"__BASEBALL__ They are not trading anyone I imagine, why fix what isn't broken?"
"__BASEBALL__ I mean if another team gets better by trade, like the Yankees."
"__BASEBALL__ Ah yeah, that would suck. I still think though the Astros are very good."
"__BASEBALL__ Certainly, I hope we will see them in the World Series."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that would be a dream come true."
