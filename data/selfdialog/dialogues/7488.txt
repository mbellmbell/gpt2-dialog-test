"__LADY_GAGA__ Did you know that Lady Gaga performed at the Miss Universe Pageant in 2008?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I love Lady Gaga's music but I have no idea what the Miss Universe pageant is."
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is a pageant that women compete in. In 2008 the pageant was held in Vietnam."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That is cool. I wonder if Lady Gaga was well know in Vietnam at that time?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I don't know. She was not really that famous yet."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Which song did she sing at the pageant?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think she sung 'Just Dance' during the swimsuit competition."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh alright. That is one of her first mainstream songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, I did not care for that song. I prefer her later songs."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I disagree. I think her earlier stuff is better than the stuff she has now."
