"__MOVIES__ What was the most pleasant surprise last year?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?  Movie-wise."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, sorry for not being specific."
"__MOVIES__ I would actually say Hacksaw Ridge."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that was really good!"
"__MOVIES__ It really was.  What was surprising is I didn't even know Mel Gibson directed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah!  He didn't slap his name all over the promos for it."
"__MOVIES__ Well, with some of his recent publicity, that makes sense."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  Was probably a smart move overall."
"__MOVIES__ But the movie itself you liked?"
"__MOVIES__ It was beautifully shot.  Great war scenes throughout and great acting."
"__MOVIES__ I heard Andrew Garfield was quite good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he showed some pretty serious acting chops."
"__MOVIES__ And it was based on a true story, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Not sure how much was fiction vs. real, but based on one."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to give it a shot.  I love a good war movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'll loan you my copy if you want."
"__MOVIES__ Is it kid appropriate?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  Wait until they are a teenager for this one."
