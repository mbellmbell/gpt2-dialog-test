"__STAR_WARS__ Who was your favorite character in The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ General Hux!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait, who's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He's the red-haired general who's in charge of the Nights of Ren. He runs the Starkiller Base."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, the shouty one who acts like a dictator."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he gets pretty angry, but he has a really interesting backstory."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, okay! Honestly, I was really excited to see Finn!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Finn is so fantastic! Honestly, he will make the whole series so much more emotional."
"__STAR_WARS__ How come?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Since we can love a character who used to be a Stormtrooper, we can see that every Stormtrooper has the potential to be a person that we care about. So it's hard to see them get shot down, even if they have to be."
