"__MOVIES__ Did you see Ace Ventura is currently being remade?"
"__MOVIES__ I did not catch that."
"__MOVIES__ Without Jim Carrey though."
"__MOVIES__ That makes little to no sense."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, but thats the direction they are headed in."
"__MOVIES__ I think the movie was funny but doesnt need a reboot."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah plus I think the actor will be judged against it as well."
"__MOVIES__ Why would they not allow him to be in it?"
"__MOVIES__ I dont think thats the case."
"__MOVIES__ So, he doest want to do the film?"
"__MOVIES__ Its been over 20 years who wants to visit it again?"
"__MOVIES__ They did make sequels."
"__MOVIES__ And I do not know if they were as great."
"__MOVIES__ It also spawned an animated series."
"__MOVIES__ Thats where it got weird."
"__MOVIES__ The film was not intended for kids."
"__MOVIES__ Right so they almost dumbed it down."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was a bit inappropriate as well."
"__MOVIES__ I just dont get why they do this kind of stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Hopefully the remake or reboot never sees the light of day"
