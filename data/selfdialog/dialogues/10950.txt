"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm looking forward to seeing the New York Giants this season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they have a really good wide receiving corps, don't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Odell Beckham's gotta keep focused, if he can I can't see any other team that can match their wide receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brandon Marshall was a huge pickup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he knew he wasn't going anywhere near the playoffs, so he went to a team that has a good shot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They'll be good, provided the offensive line can keep Manning protected."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the one big Giants weakness. Nobody on that offensive line can protect the quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's time to end the Erick Flowers experiment, huh?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he's a turnstile. I thought Will Beatty was bad, but sheesh Flowers is a bust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Beatty got paid and decided that the big paycheck was good enough for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if the Giants could have upgraded in the draft, I think they may be a Super Bowl contender."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did they pick?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They took a tight end in the first round. I didn't like the pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could he at least block?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he was more known for being a pass catching tight end in college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, so no Jake Ballard/Kevin Boss type that can do both?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, sometimes I think Reese just can't evaluate certain kinds of players that well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the NFC East like it is right now, the Giants have to be strong, he's gotta be on the hot seat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I imagine if they miss the playoffs this season, he's gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A shame since he did help build some of those championship teams."
