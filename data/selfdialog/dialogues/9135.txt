"__BASEBALL__ Hi."
"__BASEBALL__ Hello."
"__BASEBALL__ How are you?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well and you?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not bad.  You into baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I enjoy baseball."
"__BASEBALL__ Ever seen a game live?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I've been to a few Braves games."
"__BASEBALL__ Turner Field is a cool ballpark."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I always liked it."
"__BASEBALL__ Aren't they moving to a new stadium?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah pretty soon."
"__BASEBALL__ Why are they doing that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Honestly I don't know, easier to get to maybe?"
"__BASEBALL__ And Turner field really isn't that old?"
"__BASEBALL__ No, built it in the mid 90s I think."
"__BASEBALL__ That must cost a fortune for a new stadium."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, probably why the braves sold all their good players."
"__BASEBALL__ Ouch."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah it was rough."
