"__MUSIC__ What do you think the music of the future is?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh electronic for sure!"
"__MUSIC__ And why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, think about recent music. Have there been really new melodies?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. I hear new sounds everyday."
"__MUSIC__ Well that's my point! The melodies are the same. I mean, how do you really make a new melody when there are so many notes. It's just a new sound everytime."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I get that. That makes sense."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah think about all of the genres of the past 100 years. what comes to mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Classic, then rock, then disco, then hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ And those are just different ways to explore sounds. So I think the future will be just trying to mix sounds even more creatively, on a computer."
"__MUSIC__ Right. So electronic, dubstep, house music. You think that's the future?"
"__MUSIC__ Baby steps toward the future. Who knows what else could happen."
"__MUSIC__ Huh. That's hard to imagine. I hope we won't run out of ideas."
"__MUSIC__ I think humans like music so much, music will never die no matter what."
"__MUSIC__ It's weird to think about that. Why do humans like music so much?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess we've been singing for millienia."
"__MUSIC__ Is it a social construct?"
"__MUSIC__ Hard to say. Can't imagine we genetically like music."
"__MUSIC__ Well, anyway, let's put on some tunes."
"__MUSIC__ Sure."
