"__STAR_WARS__ Luke didn't need training to use the Force. He needed training to avoid falling to the Dark Side. That was what the entire cave scene was about."
"__STAR_WARS__ It surely sounded like Yoda and Obi-Wan wanted him to kill Palpatine in a big fight."
"__STAR_WARS__ Sure, they did. But it wasn't enough for him to fight. He had to fight for the right reasons. Fighting out of anger would have damned him.  That was the entire point."
"__STAR_WARS__ Then why did Yoda tell him that his training was over?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because Yoda was dying and Luke needed the confidence.  It was a dumbo feather."
"__STAR_WARS__ That seems like a big risk."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, it was.  Yoda didn't have any choice, though.  There was a good chance that Luke would have fallen but he was their only hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ There was Leia, too."
"__STAR_WARS__ She wasn't really capable of fighting Luke, though.  And she'd have even less training.  She'd have fallen in a second."
"__STAR_WARS__ That might be an interesting alternate universe."
