"__DISNEY__ Who is your favorite character in Tarzan?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh Jane, obviously."
"__DISNEY__ Why do you like Jane so much?"
"__DISNEY__ I like how she finally realizes that true happiness is with Tarzan and becomes one of the apes basically."
"__DISNEY__ Well wasn't Tarzan important in making her realize that?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but Jane was the one who had to actually make the hard choice, and she did."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. I really like that funny little ape who Rosie O'Donnel plays."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah she's a really funny character in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ How do you think they slid on those trees with their bare feet?"
"__DISNEY__ I have no clue! It would have hurt."
