"__LADY_GAGA__ Lady Gaga has one of the most underrated voices in pop music."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Underrated?? She's always winning so many awards!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes, but I think she wins them because of her performances, videos, and presentation. Not specifically for her voice."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well she excels and performing. Please explain, because I don't understand where you;re coming from"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Take for example Madonna. Madonna is a legend, but her voice itself isn't all that great"
"__LADY_GAGA__ And you're saying Lady Gaga is similar?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ No, I'm saying Lady Gaga is far better. Her voice is a lot more amazing that the average pop star"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh I see. Yes I saw her singing a capella once in a viral video in a mall."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I saw that too! She sounded incredible!"
"__LADY_GAGA__ She is one of my favorite artistes out today."
