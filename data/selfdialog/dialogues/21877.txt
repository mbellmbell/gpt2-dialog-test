"__DISNEY__ So are you ready for The Incredibles 2 to come out?"
"__DISNEY__ Whoa, the Incredibles is getting a sequel??"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! It comes out in 2018!"
"__DISNEY__ Dude, that's amazing! The first one was so good."
"__DISNEY__ I quote that movie all the time, especially the intro."
"__DISNEY__ The line about feeling like the maid cracks me up every time."
"__DISNEY__ Oh and the super suit line! 'I am your wife, I am the greatest good you are ever gonna get!'"
"__DISNEY__ Frozone was truly a comedic genius."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they don't mess it up with a sequel, do you know what it's going to be about yet?"
"__DISNEY__ Not sure, but it's the same director and he said he'd never do a sequel unless he had an idea, so I'm excited."
