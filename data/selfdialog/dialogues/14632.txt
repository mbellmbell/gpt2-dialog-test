"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Howdy!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Heya! How's it going?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well thanks, and you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Pretty good. What have you been up to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh... not much... work and sleep take up most of my time. Try to squease in a movie here and there when I can though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Pretty much the same for me. Seen any good movies lately?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Depends. Do you mean on video or in theaters?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Either. Dvd first I guess - always looking for recommendations for my collection."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ In that case I've recently rewatched my favorite movies for the umpteenth time."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ And they are...."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Donnie Darko, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, Stardust, Warm Bodies, Southland Tales, Rushmore, and Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh! I LOVE Jay & Silent Bob Strikes Back! Did you hear about the sequel?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Of course. HUGE Kevin Smith fan."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too. My favorite two of his are Clerks, a true cinematic classic, and a tossup between Mallrats and Dogma."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Dogma is hilarious. It used to be the movie I used to introduce my friends to his works."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Used to? What do you use now?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ For my more mature friends Clerks but otherwise Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back since it's modern, has an AMAZING cast, and it's absolute hilarious."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ But what about me? You started me with Mallrats."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Dude, that movie is so us though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Snoogins. Would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?"
