"__DISNEY__ I think Beauty and the Beast is one of the most unique Disney films."
"__DISNEY__ How so?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, usually a character like the Beast would be Villain, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, maybe, he is a prince or something."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but he's also a monster."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. So what else?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, the actual villain is a stuck-up version of the character that would usually be the hero."
"__DISNEY__ Ah, so that's what you meant."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. Gaston and the Beast totally switch roles."
"__DISNEY__ I get that. That's fascinating."
