"__MUSIC__ This one's a bit different as it harkens back to another era."
"__MUSIC__ You mean their older stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Right, reminds you more of Parachutes."
"__MUSIC__ So this isn't electronic at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, has a dirty beat to it kind of."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds promising."
"__MUSIC__ I really like how midway through the song, it catches a tempo."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of like Politik?"
"__MUSIC__ Kind of, it takes urgency on as it rises."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool.  I thought they were done with new songs though."
"__MUSIC__ They did say on their last album that that was their last."
"__MUSIC__ Then how do they have a new song?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they'll always make music honestly."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that or just release some EP's."
