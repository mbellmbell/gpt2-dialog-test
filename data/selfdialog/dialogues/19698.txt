"__MOVIES__ Did you get to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2?"

"__MOVIES__ Yes, it's crazy how much money those movies make internationally."
"__MOVIES__ So what is your favorite Marvel movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that's a tough one.  There have been so many now."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  They make like five of them each year!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm still going to have to go with the one that kicked off this whole thing."
"__MOVIES__ Iron Man, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Iron Man.  Almost 10 years old now, but it's still a terrific movie."
"__MOVIES__ And like you said, it's success paved the way for all these additional superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  I don't think there's been a bad Marvel movie since then though.  They have all been good."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  I think they have the superhero movie recipe down perfectly."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  Just a lot of fun without taking themselves too seriously."
"__MOVIES__ So don't know about my favorite movie, but my favorite character is Captain America."
