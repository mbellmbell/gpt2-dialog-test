"__MOVIES__ You were up late last night. What was that movie you were watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Bone Tomahawk. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Is that that Western film with Kurt Russell?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the one!"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it. Any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a slow burner, takes a long time to get started, but once it takes off it's incredible!"
"__MOVIES__ What's the story about?"
"__MOVIES__ A few people from a local town get kidnapped by a native tribe, but it's no ordinary tribe."
"__MOVIES__ What's so different about this tribe?"
"__MOVIES__ They're trogdolytes, and use bone whistles embedded in their throats to communicate. They also happen to be cannibals."
"__MOVIES__ Wow that sounds really creepy. Is it a horror movie then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I guess that's what it turns into after awhile."
"__MOVIES__ So the kidnapped people get eaten?"
"__MOVIES__ Some of them do, I guess. But Kurt Russell organizes a party to go out and search for them. That's when it gets good."
"__MOVIES__ Who else is in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's see.. Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, David Arquette."
"__MOVIES__ Nice cast. Maybe I'll check it out. Is it on Amazon Prime?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is. Right now it's one of their free included features, but that won't be forever, so better check it out fast!"
"__MOVIES__ I will! But I don't think I'll watch it at night. I don't want to have bad dreams."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah you'll have trouble falling asleep after watching it, for sure!"
