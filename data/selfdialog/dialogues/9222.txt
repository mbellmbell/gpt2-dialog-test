"__BASEBALL__ So what do you think about the Sox this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ They could use a third-base man."
"__BASEBALL__ I know. It's the worst in the AL."
"__BASEBALL__ I can't believe they really thought Sandoval would be the answer."
"__BASEBALL__ He looked good in Spring Training."
"__BASEBALL__ True. He actually lost weight."
"__BASEBALL__ He did. Maybe he'll be OK when he's back off IR."
"__BASEBALL__ I think they should bring up the kid from Portland."
"__BASEBALL__ I think he needs at least a few months there. Maybe August."
"__BASEBALL__ Hopefully they're in contention come August."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, David Price goes tonight I think in Pawtucket."
"__BASEBALL__ That would be a big help. Sale can't do it alone."
"__BASEBALL__ True that. But he's been must see TV this spring."
"__BASEBALL__ The guy has struck out double-digits seven games in a row and counting."
"__BASEBALL__ When's his next start."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure but I think it might be tonight as well."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. But it's a late start west coast game."
"__BASEBALL__ I hate those games. Oakland tonight right?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. I'm not sure how they're doing this year."
"__BASEBALL__ Me neither. But hey, Billy Beane always has them close it seems."
