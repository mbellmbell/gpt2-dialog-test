"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know American Football grew out of English sports such as rugby and soccer?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it became popular on American college campuses in the late 1800s. The NFL was founded on August 20, 1920."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did not know that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Technically, it was the American Professional Football Association. 2 years later it changed its name to the National Football League, which would ultimately become the major league of American football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are just full of fun football facts, aren't you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know the most watched television event in the United States is the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not surprising. It's almost like a major holiday."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you know it takes about 600 cows to make one full seasonâ€™s worth of NFL footballs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's a lot. I guess all that beef gets served during the game!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously, Wilson Sporting Goods Company from Ada, Ohio, has been the official football supplier for the NFL since 1941."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good gig to have."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they make more than 2 million footballs of all sorts every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Crazy! They don't call it America's favorite past time for nothing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't that baseball?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, football, especially the degree to which those NFL players play is so major."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well think of the cow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The cow?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A cow has only a 1 in 17,420,000 chance of becoming an NFL football that is used in the Super Bowl!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is nuts, you would be better off playing the lottery. Though I don't think becoming a Superbowl ball would be a big win for that cow!"
