"__MOVIES__ I went and saw that movie Split the other day at the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, I saw it couple of days ago."
"__MOVIES__ Who was your favorite of the personalities that Kevin turned into?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the best was Hedwig. The best part was when he was dancing to the Kanye West song in his room."
"__MOVIES__ That part was pretty funny. James McAvoy was able to do a great job portraying each role, he was really believable."
"__MOVIES__ I thought he did a good job jumping back and forth between the characters and making each one its own."
"__MOVIES__ Im glad they didn't put all 23 personalities in the movie though. It would have been too complicated."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, sometimes it was hard to remember between the names and personalites."
"__MOVIES__ There were a lot of good parts though like when he killed the therapist."
"__MOVIES__ I know right? I was kinda mad that she was so oblivious and went to his house."
"__MOVIES__ I had a feeling he was going to let Casey go though, I thought it was a little predictable."
"__MOVIES__ I thought all 3 girls were going to get killed when he turned into the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ The part I didn't get was the ending where Bruce Willis talks about Mr. Glass. What was that about?"
"__MOVIES__ The reference is to another movie by the same director called Unbreakable."
"__MOVIES__ Whats that movie about?"
"__MOVIES__ It has Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson in it. Bruce has superhuman powers and abilities; he is able to see what crimes people have committed by touching them."
"__MOVIES__ So unless you have seen the movie you wouldn't get the referance?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. You should go watch it, it is just as good as Split."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I wiil have to watch it then when Split comes out on DVD I will have to watch that one again too."
"__MOVIES__ Good idea!"
