"__MOVIES__ I am trying to figure out how to get into the whole Star Wars movies."
"__MOVIES__ I can help."
"__MOVIES__ Really? You know them and like them."
"__MOVIES__ Like a second nature. How far are you in?"
"__MOVIES__ I have only seen Rogue One."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a good movie, but I was kind of lost."
"__MOVIES__ You need to start with the basic films. The ones centered around the Skywalkers."
"__MOVIES__ The ones with Harrison Ford in them?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, to start."
"__MOVIES__ Do I start with his series or the ones with Hayden Chritiansen."
"__MOVIES__ That is always the dilemma. I say start with the Harrison Ford ones."
"__MOVIES__ Which movie do I watch first."
"__MOVIES__ Star Wars, A new Hope."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the first one?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes and no."
"__MOVIES__ What does that even mean."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it is the first one made, but no not the first on the story."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is confusing."
"__MOVIES__ Just wait until I explain the sequels."
