"__BASKETBALL__ Do you follow basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not as much as I used to. What about you."
"__BASKETBALL__ I watch as many games as I can, including college and professional."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah? Well, I usually check out the scores, but don't really watch many games. Whose you favorite pro team?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I grew up in California, so I always root for the Lakers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me to. They've had some great teams and great players over the years."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know they usually come up with some great player combinations. Remember when they had Elgin Baylor and Jerry West."
"__BASKETBALL__ That was a great combo. You can talk about your Jordans all you want, but I love to watch Baylor play."
"__BASKETBALL__ He was really something. He used to actually get hangs time when he went to the basket."
"__BASKETBALL__ Hang time? What do you mean by that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ For some reason if he and another player jumped at the same time, he seemed to stay up in the air longer and it gave him an advantage."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh. I didn't realize that, but he was fun to watch. My favorite was Magic Johnson."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know, he just had a way of controlling the whole game."
"__BASKETBALL__ He did. He was a winner. There's just something about some players. They just have a way of winning no matter what."
"__BASKETBALL__ Right. Did you ever play much basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Nope. I'm too short, and I don't jump very well. Maybe that's why I don't follow the game all that closely."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. Basketball is made for tall people. Wouldn't it be great if they had a league with a height limit? Nobody over six feet."
"__BASKETBALL__ Then they could lower the basket so that six footers could dunk."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's interesting to think about. Do you think you would play more then?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Nope. I'm still too short."
