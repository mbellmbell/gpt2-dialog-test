"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Alexander Scriabin?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who's that?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a turn-of-the-Century composer in Russia."
"__MUSIC__ Which century?"
"__MUSIC__ Late 19th-early 20th."
"__MUSIC__ So, why are you bringing him up?"
"__MUSIC__ He tried to end the world. With music."
"__MUSIC__ WHAT? How?"
"__MUSIC__ He had a vision that his symphony would bring upon the apocalypse."
"__MUSIC__ That must have been super dissonant."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, his music wasn't."
"__MUSIC__ So how would it have worked?"
"__MUSIC__ He imagined it being performed in the mountains, with huge bells, lights, and the full orchestra and choir."
"__MUSIC__ Kind of the ultimate culmination of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Pretty much."
"__MUSIC__ So, why didn't it work?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, we're alive, so it failed."
"__MUSIC__ Right, ha. He died before it finished."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe he miscalculated: 'End me' instead of 'End the World'"
