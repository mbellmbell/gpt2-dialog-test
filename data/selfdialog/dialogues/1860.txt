"__MUSIC__ Music has come a long way in the last 20 years."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you say that?"
"__MUSIC__ It seems like there are so many different genres now."
"__MUSIC__ I see what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah like wasn't it just rock and country until a few years ago?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I think when disco came on the scene it spurred a movement."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that when punk, metal, and all those started popping up."
"__MUSIC__ Now there are more genres and a wider variety to choose from."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes it's hard to know what to choose."
"__MUSIC__ I tend to go for the trendy artists like Katy Perry and Lady GaGa"
"__MUSIC__ Not me.  I like the under rated artists."
"__MUSIC__ Like who?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I love Lana Delrey, and you don't really hear alot from her."
"__MUSIC__ Florence and the Machine are great too, and you don't hear much from them either."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like the artists they play on the radio are the same ones over and over."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it does. Unless you are listening to alternative."
"__MUSIC__ I am a subscriber to sirius xm and the channels i listen to have a tendency to play the same artists all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Yes i had it but got rid of it for that very reason."
"__MUSIC__ Can't justify paying that kind of money for just a few songs."
"__MUSIC__ That's true.  Cheaper to pay 10 for google play and make your own lists."
