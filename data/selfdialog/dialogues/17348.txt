"__MOVIES__ What do you think about singers that delve into acting?"
"__MOVIES__ To be honest, I wish they would stick with singing."
"__MOVIES__ I have to agree with you."
"__MOVIES__ Evem though Carrie Underwood had a very small role in Soul Surfer, she was still very bad."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. She came off as too cheerful and her speech wasn't natural."
"__MOVIES__ However, I do have to say that Mariah Carey was great in Precious."
"__MOVIES__ She was almost unrecognizable in that role."
"__MOVIES__ I was so pleasantly surprised how she held her own with Mo'Nique in the scene near the end of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Mo'Nique's performance was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ She definitely deserved the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I wish she would get more roles."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. It's been a long time since I've seen her in anything."
"__MOVIES__ I think the last big thing she starred in was Bessie."
"__MOVIES__ I believe that movie won four Emmy Awards."
"__MOVIES__ That's amazing for a television movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Going back to what we were talking about earlier.. Queen Latifah was in that movie, too."
"__MOVIES__ You know what?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ I think music artists that turn to acting aren't so bad after all."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you're right. There are some pretty talented actors that started off as singers."
