"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see the Force Awakens yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I saw it when it came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was kind of over-rated to be honest."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? Everyone I've talked to liked it."
"__STAR_WARS__ It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I see. I was thinking of renting it from redbox this weekend."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not as good as the first three but definitely worth renting."
"__STAR_WARS__ Cool I guess I'll check it out."
"__STAR_WARS__ If you don't expect to much from it you'll enjoy it."
