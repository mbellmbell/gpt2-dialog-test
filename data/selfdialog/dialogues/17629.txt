"__MOVIES__ There are a few other's in the movie too, but they're really just supporting roles.  Except for Walton Goggins."
"__MOVIES__ Who was he in the movie? Did i see him in any of the trailers?"
"__MOVIES__ He plays a dubious sheriff. They all actually play some sort of archetype or role. Jackson is 'the Bounty Hunter', Russel is 'the Hangman, and Leigh is 'the Prisoner.'"
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that is four of them. Who are the other four?"
"__MOVIES__ There is an old man who is a general, he is 'the Confederate'; then there is an English man who is 'the Little Man.'"
"__MOVIES__ So they all have nicknames? How long is this movie that they all came up with nicknames for each other?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they didn't give each other nicknames. These are just the names you see if you look at the billing or different movie posters."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I get it, so who were the last two?"
"__MOVIES__ There was also 'the Mexican' and 'the Cowpuncher.'"
"__MOVIES__ That first one doesn't sound racist at all."
"__MOVIES__ I guess. Maybe it is today, but it's a time period piece, so there are going to be a lot of offensive things in the movie. You just need to put it into context."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I can guess why the 'Mexican' is called that. the 'Cowpuncher' sounds stupid though."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you have to see the movie for it to make sense. The cowpuncher is this rancher who has been herding cattle all of his life running them from one place to another selling them. It's a really common story in old westerns."
"__MOVIES__ Did people used to really do that?"
"__MOVIES__ Someone had to move the beef, and moving thousands of them by train would have been impossible."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, and somehow all of these people come together and hate each other?"
"__MOVIES__ Not exactly. Kurt Russel is quickly established as a very paranoid person. He questions everyone and always sees conspiracies around himself."
"__MOVIES__ So he spurs the anger?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, he feels there is something off with someone's story in the group that he ends up in, so he starts to create dividing lines between everyone."
"__MOVIES__ So wouldn't that mean it was all Russel's fault?"
