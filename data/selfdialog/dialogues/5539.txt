"__STAR_WARS__ You know what would make an awesome final side movie?  An Obi Wan story."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes!  That would be perfect."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd like to see him in between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too.  Helping the Rebellion and maybe fighting some of Vader's minions."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even an encounter with the bad man himself."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be cool.  Also maybe he's Rey's grandfather."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've heard that theory, and that would make for some good back story on her."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it would.  Her past is way too much of a mystery."
"__STAR_WARS__ Plus Obi Wan was one of the best characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Ewan McGregor played him very well."
