"__MOVIES__ If you could bring back one comedian who died, who would you pick?"
"__MOVIES__ I would go with Chris Farley."
"__MOVIES__ That would be epic."
"__MOVIES__ I grew up watching him doing somersaults through walls and table, I miss him."
"__MOVIES__ He is a hard man to replace in a film."
"__MOVIES__ I think Kevin James is as close to a stand in that we can get."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he is pretty spry for a hefty fellow, but Chris had better slapstick."
"__MOVIES__ Well no one falls through a table like him, it was like he didn't even register it after it happened; beautiful."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen Tommy boy like 50 times, and the first scene is still my favorite for him."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, when he just passed out and dropped to the floor through a table."
"__MOVIES__ That's the one, I know it wasn't as energetic as most of his falls but that one just makes me laugh more."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean, but there is no better scene than 'Fat guy in a little coat.'"
"__MOVIES__ Touche, that is most definitely one of his greatest one liners."
"__MOVIES__ Well it's been 20 years and it's still going strong."
"__MOVIES__ I just wish he could be back on SNL."
"__MOVIES__ The things that came out of his mouth when it was unscripted, were just pure genius."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see Beverley hills' Ninja?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah like 20 times, how could you not?"
"__MOVIES__ I laugh every time at the final fight scene when he's trying to defuse the bomb, but he takes about the phone instead."
"__MOVIES__ I always lose it when he hooks Gobei to the bus then sends him flying over the cliff."
