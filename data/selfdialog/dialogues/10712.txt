"__FASHION__ Why is it that every-time I turn around someone on TV is wearing a blouse with the shoulders cut out?"
"__FASHION__ It is the new in trend, you know."
"__FASHION__ Why? It is not all that appealing to me."
"__FASHION__ Really? I think it is sexy. Showing a little skin, it looks good."
"__FASHION__ Not to me it doesn't.  Some of these hosts already show too much skin as it is if you ask me."
"__FASHION__ You aren't kidding with that one."
"__FASHION__ Last night while I was watching the news with my five year old son, the female host dress showed too much cleavage."
"__FASHION__ This morning, while I was watching the daily news talk shows, one of the hosts was wearing what looked like a halter top."
"__FASHION__ You're kidding? On national TV?"
"__FASHION__ I sent them an email telling them how I was appalled by her attire."
"__FASHION__ They probably disregarded your email."
"__FASHION__ I don't think they did. Because after they returned from there next commercial break, she was wearing blazer over it."
"__FASHION__ I hate to ask this but did the blazer match her outfit?"
"__FASHION__ No. No it did not. Her halter top was red, her pants were black and the blazer was lime green."
"__FASHION__ Lime green? I can't imagine how humiliated she must have felt."
"__FASHION__ I sure she was but when you go on live TV at the time of day when children are watching  and you are dressed like that, then oh well."
"__FASHION__ You're right. I understand where you are coming from."
"__FASHION__ Even though she was dressed inappropriately, I actually liked the earrings she was wearing."
"__FASHION__ What did they look like?"
"__FASHION__ They were circular dangles with what look like blue gemstones going down the middle."
