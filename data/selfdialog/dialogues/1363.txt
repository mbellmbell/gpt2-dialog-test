"__MUSIC__ Do you know if Nelly is still producing music?"
"__MUSIC__ Nelly, the rapper. Or Nelly Furtado, the female artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Nelly, the rapper dude."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm not sure. I haven't heard anything from him recently."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure he still is even though he doesn't seem to be very popular."
"__MUSIC__ I only remember a few of his songs from the early 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ Which ones stick out in your mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I don't know. E.I. and Hot in Here."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, those were some of his more popular songs."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know too many of his songs besides that. His music just screams early 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ That's why I was asking. It seems as if he hasn't had any major hits since the early 2000s."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think he has either. I was really confused when Nellie Furtado came on the scene."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ I heard the name Nellie Furtado being thrown around and had no idea she was a female singer and was different from Nelly the rapper."
"__MUSIC__ So you thought that Nelly just changed his stage name to Nellie Furtado?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that's exactly what I thought. Kind of like some other artists."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of like Puff Daddy changing his name to P-Diddy?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, just like that."
"__MUSIC__ Always weird when artists do that. Sometimes it seems as if it is just a marketing scheme to sell more records."
"__MUSIC__ Can't blame them though. It's a brutal business out there to sell hits and make a living."
