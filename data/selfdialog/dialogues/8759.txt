"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite Beatles song?"
"__BEATLES__ That's a tough one. There are so many good songs..."
"__BEATLES__ Well if you had to choose two then."
"__BEATLES__ Ok, well I really like 'Here Comes the Sun' and 'Blackbird'."
"__BEATLES__ Great songs. I love 'Blackbird'."
"__BEATLES__ It's such a beautiful song. My favorite part is the guitar melody that they play."
"__BEATLES__ That song is definitely more toned down and less crazy than some of their other ones."
"__BEATLES__ Yea. Although their more rowdy songs are a lot of fun too."
"__BEATLES__ I love 'Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da'. It's so silly, but so catchy at the same time."
"__BEATLES__ Yea. It tells such a cute story too."
