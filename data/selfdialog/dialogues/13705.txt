"__BASKETBALL__ Will an expansion team ever come to the NBA?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Vegas could be next"
"__BASKETBALL__ Do they really need expansion though?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Not really, the qaulity of rosters isnt that great right now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I think they need to tell future players they have to wait 3 years out of high school."
"__BASKETBALL__ The problem is theyll just go overseas."
"__BASKETBALL__ Then they should say 3 years in college."
"__BASKETBALL__ How do you tell a player they have to go to school though when they have free will?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I dont know they have to figure that out."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well back to Vegas, do you think a 2nd team will come in?"
"__BASKETBALL__ With the way games are scheduled I dont think you need to have 2 teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah they could probably do with just 1."
"__BASKETBALL__ How do you staff a team like that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Let them pick 1, 2, and 3 in the NBA draft and then make 5 selections from the best 5 teams in the league."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why punish a team for having a good roster?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well you want the franchise to be good, to increase attendance."
"__BASKETBALL__ I dont see that being an issue in Vegas."
"__BASKETBALL__ Its more of a tourist place though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah but to catch a sporting event out there? People would do it."
"__BASKETBALL__ They may but you need a winner on the court right away."
