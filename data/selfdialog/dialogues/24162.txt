"__SUPERHERO__ Do you like the old Superman movie, or the first Spiderman movie from 2002 better?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I prefer Spiderman, just because I saw it when I was young."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you see the old Superman?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes, but not in theaters. I loved it though."
"__SUPERHERO__ How come you do not like newer superhero movies?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Too many effects and not enough craft."
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. The older films had a better craft and they were more innovative."
"__SUPERHERO__ The James Franco Spiderman was really good. I wish they used more practical effects though."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, the green goblin character could have been cooler and looked excellent."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was still good though."
