"__MOVIES__ Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen a couple of his movies. Psycho, of course, everyone has seen Psycho."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if his talents would be appreciated so much today as they were back when he was directing."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MOVIES__ He didn't really go for explicit gory stuff - it was more about suggestion, and letting the viewer's mind fill in all the scary details."
"__MOVIES__ But in Psycho, we watch Janet Leigh get stabbed to death in the shower! Like a million times?"
"__MOVIES__ Ah, but the knife never actually penetrates her skin. The cuts were chosen very carefully to give that impression, but it's all suggestion."
"__MOVIES__ No way! I could have sworn I saw the knife go in."
"__MOVIES__ That was Hitchcock's genius. He let the viewer's mind do a lot of the work for him."
"__MOVIES__ What are some of your favorite Hitchcock films?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought The Birds was really creepy, mostly because you never actually find out what makes the birds turn evil and attack people."
"__MOVIES__ I have a parakeet at home - I would be pretty nervous if I thought she might attack me sometime, right out of the blue."
"__MOVIES__ That's why the film is so disturbing - it takes something normal and harmless like a sparrow and turns it into a killing machine."
"__MOVIES__ I liked his more sparkly, light films, like To Catch a Thief."
"__MOVIES__ Cary Grand and Grace Kelly made such a beautiful couple. And Jessie Royce Landis, I loved her role as Grace's mom."
"__MOVIES__ She was in another of Hitchcock's films, wasn't she?"
"__MOVIES__ She played Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest, another of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Wait a minute, she and Grant were like the same age, weren't they?"
"__MOVIES__ But she was totally believable as Grant's mom because she made you believe her in the role. I loved her sass in both of those movies."
"__MOVIES__ You make me want to go rent a few Hitchcock films now."
