"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Eric Church?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who is that?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a country artist.  My friend dragged me to a concert last weekend, and suprisingly,  I love him."
"__MUSIC__ I can say that I have heard anything of his, but I don't really enjoy country that much."
"__MUSIC__ I can't say that I like it that much, either, but I do like him."
"__MUSIC__ Why is he different?"
"__MUSIC__ I really enjoy his lyrics.  They tell more of a story than a lot of others do."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool!  Any suggestions for something I should listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like the song 'Record Year.'"
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check it out.  I'm just not really all that into country."
"__MUSIC__ I'd say the same about myself, I'm usually more into rock music. Coutry sounds very repetitive to me."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't like that its so twangy.  I feel like sometimes it's way too exaggerated."
"__MUSIC__ I can totally understand that.  Personally, I mostly listen to rock and pop."
"__MUSIC__ I do too, but I have a weakness for 90's r&b and hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ That's awesome.  I usually throw a couple of those on my work out play lists."
"__MUSIC__ They are great for cool downs,  and anything that requires a steady rhythm."
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  I always think of those old Jock Jams CDS when I work out."
"__MUSIC__ Fast hip hop like that is great, especially when I'm on a long run."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed.  I don't think I could workout if i didn't have he headphones."
"__MUSIC__ I am the exact same way!"
