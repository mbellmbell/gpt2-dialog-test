"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't believe the pAnthers picked up McCaffrey."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so? Panthers is a running team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why. They have already pretty good running game, what they shoould've done is a picked up a good WR."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well Panther's running game is largely driven by Jonathan Stewart and Cam Newton"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Cam's the second in their team in terms of running yards"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And that's not really a good thing, because the QB can get hurt running. They need another RB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have other RBs,. Whitaker, Artis-Payne, etc. Don't need another RB"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they're not as good as McCaffrey. He's a beast"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is good. i wished they picked up another WR or a TE"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Another TE on top of Olsen? Olsen is already no 3 TE in the league"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who's no 1? Gronk?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, Surprisingly, Travis Kelce"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, Alex Smith does love his TEs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And to think the beginning of the season last year, we were all like 'OMG, KC Chiefs running game is stacked!'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, Charcandrick West was such a disappointment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anyway, another WR for Panthers is kinda redundant at this time. Between Olsen, Benjamin and Ginn Jr, they have over 2700 yards"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How does that comp[are to other teams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like in terms of passing yards? The team that passes the most is New Orleans Saints. Brees loves to throw. They had over 5000 yards passing last year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's close to double that of panthers"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well passing between the top 3 of Pather's receiving core. Pathers had over 3600 yards passing last year"
