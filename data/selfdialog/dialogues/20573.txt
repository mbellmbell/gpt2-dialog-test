"__MOVIES__ You seen the new Fast and Furious movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't thinking of waiting for it to come out on DVD."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man, it was AWESOME!  It's the best one yet."
"__MOVIES__ Which one is it anyway?  How many of those are they up to?"
"__MOVIES__ This is the eight one, that's why it's 'fate of the furious' as in f plus 'eight' you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Ahh.. clever.  So, tell me, does this one feature a big car chase?"
"__MOVIES__ (....) Dude, they ALL feature a big car chase."
"__MOVIES__ Hehe... someone missed the joke there, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ So, anyway, they got this awesome scene where they're out on the ice and there's a freaking submarine after them."
"__MOVIES__ Uh.. what a submarine?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah!  It is SO cool!"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting.  Like I said, I'll probably check it out, but I think I'll wait to get it on DVD or something."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but then you'll miss the FULL experience!  You're speakers can't match the awesome theater sound system!"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, last theater I went too I think they had the sound jacked up a bit too high."
"__MOVIES__ Really?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, hurt my freaking ears."
"__MOVIES__ What was the last movie you've seen in the theater, anyway?"
"__MOVIES__ Uh... let me think... it's been a while"
"__MOVIES__ Take your time, I know you're getting old and all..."
"__MOVIES__ Ahh, shut up!  Actually, I think it was Guardians of the Galaxy."
