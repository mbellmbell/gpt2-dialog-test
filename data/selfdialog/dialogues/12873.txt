"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you a football fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, but I used to be a huge fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why don't you follow it closely anymore?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Cincinnati Bengals fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What does that have to do with it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I couldn't watch them lose in the first round of the playoffs every year anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They used to be so bad, though!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I started watching on a weekly basis in 1995 and considered myself a diehard fan until the second playoff loss to Pittsburgh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How are they looking this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know that much about them anymore, but I know they have offensive line issues that will make it hard to compete."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Marvin Lewis?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's made things much better than the 1990s but it's clear to me they won't be able to take the next step with him at the helm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's been there forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, he will never be fired. This is his 15th year coming up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of Andy Dalton?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's solidly a slightly above-average QB. His performance will hinge upon whether they can protect him, which is the team's main issue headed into 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about AJ Green?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ AJ Green is truly great. It's been really exciting seeing the Bengals have a league-best talent, it's been really rare. With him and Geno Atkins it's been really cool to see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to follow the Bengals in the upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We'll see. I'm thinking about it right now."
