"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who's the best duo: Outkast or UGK?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'd have to say UGK. They have that southern, raw, down home sound that is relateable on many levels."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? I'd say Outkast."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why Outkast? They aren't even rapping together anymore."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ UGK isn't rapping together either. But I like how down Outkast is for Atlanta, but they don't let their 'donwness' stop them from getting their coins."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Are you saying that UGK is too down?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Bun B talked about it in The Story. He considered doing a Big Pimpin 2."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But they didn't make it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's because didn't want to seem like he sold out to his original fan base."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, UGK is still better than Outkast."
