"__MUSIC__ What music do you listen to with your kids?"
"__MUSIC__ All kinds of stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ They love the beatles, and my son especially loves Seal."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Especially Kiss From a Rose."
"__MUSIC__ No, I mean- you play that music for them?"
"__MUSIC__ Why wouldn't I?"
"__MUSIC__ Because it's not for kids."
"__MUSIC__ That makes no sense. It's not like it's inappropriate."
"__MUSIC__ No... I guess it isn't."
"__MUSIC__ It totally isn't. I'm not playing them Wutang Clan stuff or anything."
"__MUSIC__ But shouldn't they be listening to Raffi or something?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, don't get me wrong. Raffi's actually pretty rad."
"__MUSIC__ He is. Baby Beluga was my jam."
"__MUSIC__ Mhm. But in my experience, kids feel the same way that we do about kids music."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, they think it sucks, just like we do."
"__MUSIC__ No way."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. The second you play them some real music, they can tell the difference. Try it next time. They'll love it."
