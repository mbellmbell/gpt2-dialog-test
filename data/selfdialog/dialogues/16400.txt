"__ROCK__ What is your favorite rock band of all time?"
"__ROCK__ There are too many from which to select although at least 3 are my favorites."
"__ROCK__ I agree but The Eagles probably do it for me. So does Lynyrd Skynrnd and the Doobie Brothers"
"__ROCK__ Why the Eagles as #1?"
"__ROCK__ Because they were the first to turn country into country rock. Their melodies were incredible."
"__ROCK__ I agree I can listen to 'Take it Easy' any time of the night or day. So cool."
"__ROCK__ I also think the band improved when they added Joe Walsh in 1977."
"__ROCK__ Oh, no doubt. He had such a great solo career before then and he added a harder version to the band."
"__ROCK__ He was a fantastic addition. You know Joe always is in the top 50 guitarists per Rolling Stone magazine."
"__ROCK__ His work on Hotel California was legendary for sure. Even better guitarist than the founders."
