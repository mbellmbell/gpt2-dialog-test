"__MOVIES__ I watched The Lego Movie last night, you have got to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Which one, the Batman one?"
"__MOVIES__ No, this was the original that came out in 2014.  I haven't seen the Batman one yet but I want to now."
"__MOVIES__ How was the original? I haven't seen it."
"__MOVIES__ It was great!  It stars Chris Pratt and Will Ferrell and it's really funny."
"__MOVIES__ I heard it was pretty good.  I've been meaning to see it."
"__MOVIES__ You should.  It has a slightly slow start, but once it gets going you'll really get into it."
"__MOVIES__ What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ There's this Lego construction worker who thinks he's 'special' and he's trying to stop the Lego World from being glued together permanently."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds weird."
"__MOVIES__ No, it's not as bizarre as it sounds.  It turns into sort of a hero adventure, and he meets a lot of neat characters on the way."
"__MOVIES__ Is there a bad guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's some evil villain that he's trying to stop.  He bands up with a lot of others to help."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds pretty interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and it's funny too.  It also has a good moral at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Well I'll have to check it out.  I've been wanting to see the Batman one but I'll watch this one first."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Batman is in this one.  He's a pretty major character."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so I guess it's a sequel"
"__MOVIES__ I guess so, but I'm not sure."
"__MOVIES__ I'll watch it and let you know."
