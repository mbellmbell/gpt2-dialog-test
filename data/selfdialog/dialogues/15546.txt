"__HARRY_POTTER__ So who is your favorite Harry Potter movie character? Besides Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Besides Snape, I would have to say Luna Lovegood."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She's a trip, but I think my favorite by far is McGonagall."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah. Maggie Smith killed that role."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of all of the older British actresses that I know, she fits the part the best."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ As if you know more than her and Judy Dench."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Anyhow. I loved the scene during the Battle of Hogwarts when she brought the statues to live."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ 'I've always wanted to use that spell.' She looked SO happy when she said that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ It's another reason that that character was such a boss witch."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Ha. I see what you did there. Yes, I would have loved to have her as a teacher, or a grandmother, or just a neighbor."
