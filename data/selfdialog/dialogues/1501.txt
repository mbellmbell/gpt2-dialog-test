"__MUSIC__ Have you seen a Manfred Mann concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No."
"__MUSIC__ I saw one back in 1980 in Germany, it was awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Really, why?"
"__MUSIC__ They had a cartoon playing during one of their songs,"
"__MUSIC__ What was it about?"
"__MUSIC__ It showed a guy shopping and came across a can of instant fun."
"__MUSIC__ Say what?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah and it showed him starting to open the can and then it showed a flash."
"__MUSIC__ What then?"
"__MUSIC__ Next thing it shows the guy running to the store and getting a cart full of cans."
"__MUSIC__ So then what?"
"__MUSIC__ Then they show his house with flashes going off all the time,"
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha, so."
"__MUSIC__ Then it shows him running back and fourth with more carts full."
"__MUSIC__ What then? more flashes?"
"__MUSIC__ No, it shows him grabbing a can from a mountain of cans. Then the mountain comes falling on him, crushing him."
"__MUSIC__ Oh no."
"__MUSIC__ Then at the end it has a can roll towards you and says, Warning, too much fun is harmful to your health."
"__MUSIC__ Ha Ha, nice story."
