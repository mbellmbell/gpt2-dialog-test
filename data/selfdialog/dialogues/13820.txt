"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see game 2 between the Spurs and Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, I feel kinda bad for the poor Spurs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know right. They were blown out by 36 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, it was pretty sad."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, what can you do when the star player is injured?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The bench players have to pick up the slack."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who on the Spurs bench can do that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The only player with a lot of playoff experience is Manu."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, but Manu is 39 years old. He can only do so much."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's true. I guess the other players will have to step it up."
"__BASKETBALL__ One of the Spurs' rookie players named Murray is coming along."
"__BASKETBALL__ I saw him. He played pretty decent."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's correct. He gave them a decent 8 points and also 6 assists."
"__BASKETBALL__ He also had 6 rebounds too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, I think the Spurs will continue to give him more playing time."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so. They are probably looking ahead to the future."
"__BASKETBALL__ On the Warriors side, Curry scored 29 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, he hit a sizzling 6 three pointers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Do the Spurs even stand a chance against this team?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think so. It will be very difficult for the Spurs to beat the Warriors without Kawhi."
