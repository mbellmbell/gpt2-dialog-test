"__DISNEY__ Did you know that Disney is going to put out a live-action version of Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I heard! Who do you think they'll cast as Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ I have no idea. I hope they bring Eddie Murphy back to voice Mushu though."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm really looking forward to the battle scenes."
"__DISNEY__ Same! It'll definitely be different from Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ I've heard Disney is going to do a live-action version of Aladdin as well."
"__DISNEY__ Awesome! I'd love to see Zayn Malik portray Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ Why? He can sing, but he only has one facial expression: the smolder."
"__DISNEY__ True. They'll have to cast someone new, I think."
