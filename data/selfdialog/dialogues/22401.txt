"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the part in The Little Mermaid when Sebastian is stuck in the kitchen with the French chef?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, why?"
"__DISNEY__ That's my favorite part!"
"__DISNEY__ Haha!  Why?"
"__DISNEY__ I took French in high school, so when the French chef is saying things to him, I know what he is saying."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  I never thought about it.  Like what?"
"__DISNEY__ Like he says 'zut' which is French for 'darn!'"
"__DISNEY__ Cool."
"__DISNEY__ And the song 'Les poissons' means 'the fish'."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I get it now!  'Les poissons les poissons, how I love les poissons'."
