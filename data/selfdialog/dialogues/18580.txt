"__MOVIES__ Which is your favorite Rocky movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There are six of them, right?"
"__MOVIES__ No!  Seven, actually.  Rocky one through five, Rocky Balboa, and Creed."
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, you are right.  Seven, hmm..."
"__MOVIES__ Well I will tell you my favorite first.  I like Rocky.  The first and original."
"__MOVIES__ Well yea, that's a classic.  A really classic underdog story."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, interestingly it's a movie that I appreciate more with age."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  The story of overcoming life's challenges and defining your own success is a message that resonates more as you get older."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly!  So anyways, come on.  What is your favorite Rocky movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I want to be different from you, so I will go with Creed."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, the newest one.  Why Creed?"
"__MOVIES__ Well honestly it's borderline not even a real Rocky movie, since it focuses more on Apollo's son."
"__MOVIES__ True.  But Rocky is featured prominently, and it follows the overall storyline."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  It did have a slightly different feel than the other Rocky movies though."
"__MOVIES__ You are right.  So what did you like about Creed?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the acting of course.  Michael B. Jordan was amazing, and Stallone probably had his best acting performance ever."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  It's interesting catching up with a character you first saw in his 30s, and now he's probably 70 years old."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, it is interesting, and Stallone does a heck of a job."
"__MOVIES__ They are thinking of doing a sequel to Creed."
"__MOVIES__ I would be interested in seeing it.  And it would be the eighth Rocky movie!"
