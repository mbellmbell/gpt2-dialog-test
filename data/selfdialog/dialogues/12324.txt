"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alright, who's your pick for Superbowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, ha we haven't even started pre-season yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well still.  You must have some idea about who will be the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will probably be New England again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think?  I don't know.  They are starting to get old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you kidding.  That don't seem to affect that team. They just find a way to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's the truth.  Well I think it will be Denver for the AFC and Dallas for the NFC with the Cowboys winning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In your dreams. Denver might get there but the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, they were supposed to be there last year but had a couple bad snags."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like loosing their QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we found a diamond in the ruff though and this year he will be even better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we'll see.  I think that Carolina and Arizona will be tough to beat this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't count Green bay out either.  Ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  Rogers is still at the helm so anything can happen there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's getting about time for him to retire too ain't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he is probably getting close.  I think over the next couple of years there will be several greats that will retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know.  It's hard to believe that some of these guys have been in now for 12, 15 years now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, like Rothlessburger and what's his name down in New Orleans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Drew Breeze."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. Him too."
