"__POP__ Let's talk about pop music we like, would you like to go first?"
"__POP__ I suppose I'll join in. Although I like older pop music, like 1980s. Rick Springfield is someone I like."
"__POP__ He was a big hit in the 1980s. I remember Jessie's Girl was his big hit."
"__POP__ Springfield had over 8 top 40 hits, and won multiple Grammy awards!"
"__POP__ I did not know that. He was popular with my sister, I remember that. What do you think of Justin Timberlake?"
"__POP__ Timberlake is really talented, and super funny on Saturday Night Live. I liked that song I'm Taking Sexy Back."
"__POP__ That whole album is amazing. I used to work out to Love Stoned also. He has a simmering intensity."
"__POP__ Surprising really, he looks kind of shy until he starts dancing, which he's really talented at."
"__POP__ I heard Janet Jackson and Timberlake were romantically involved. Now Janet Jackson, she kicks it!"
"__POP__ Bet they had amazing chemistry. So much raw talent between them!"
