"__STAR_WARS__ Do you like the new star wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess they are ok."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's wrong with them?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There's nothing wrong with them, I just miss the old characters."
"__STAR_WARS__ They have a lot of the old characters in them though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, I know, but only as nostalgia."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they are too old to be action starts now."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, but I hate that they killed Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard that Harrison Ford told them to because he was tired of doing the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea I heard that too."
