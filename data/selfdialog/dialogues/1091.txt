"__MUSIC__ Do you think that Britney Spears lip syncs her live performances?"
"__MUSIC__ I have heard rumors that she does, but I'm not sure what to believe. What do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure either. She's made a few statements saying she sings live, but her vocals just sound too perfect all of the time."
"__MUSIC__ That's where I have my doubts. She's older now, but at live shows, her voice never wavers or hits an odd note."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. It still sounds exactly the same as when she was 15."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think Is it possible that she sings along and hears her voice mixed with playback in her earpiece, and assumes that's what the audience hears?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess that could be it. I know her team has done some shady stuff, so maybe they're turning her mic down on her?"
"__MUSIC__ That would make sense, they make a lot of strange decisions for her, so it wouldn't surprise me."
"__MUSIC__ She also doesn't seem to be the type of person that would go watch a playback of a performance. So if that's true, she might really not know."
"__MUSIC__ There was that theory at the VMAs that she was singing live at the end which is why she switched to a hand held mic."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that, she grabbed the mic, but it seemed like it was turned off. She didn't look very happy."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if maybe she lip syncs during the more intense dancing and sings live during the less intense dancing."
"__MUSIC__ That was actually what made me start to question her singing live, the way she sings while she's dancing."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, she's doing all this intense,hardcore,crazy, dancing, but her vocals never waver, not once. It just doesn't seem possible."
"__MUSIC__ That's actually a really good point. I never thought of that."
"__MUSIC__ In my opinion, whether she lips syncs all the time or only some of time, her true fans are going to love and support her no matter what."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. I really don't care either way, I'm still going to buy her albums and attend her concerts."
"__MUSIC__ I doubt we'll ever know for certain what the truth is. As long as she's happy and putting on a good show for the audience, I guess it doesn't matter."
"__MUSIC__ It definitely doesn't matter to me, I love her no matter that."
