"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFL season starts exactly two months from today!  Are you excited as I am?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm getting there!  Which rookie quarterback do you think will have the biggest impact?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Deshaun Watson will have a nice rookie season for the Houston Texans!  What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree about Watson, but I think Mitchell Trubisky will do well with the Bears if he gets the opportunity."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think Trubisky will do well.  He doesn't have anyone to throw to now that Alshon Jeffrey signed with the Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  I don't think he will probably get a lot of playing time with Mike Glennon beginning the year as the starting quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  Who do you think will win rookie of the year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Leonard Fournette for sure if he can stay healthy.  He will get a lot of touches for the Jaguars and will bust some big plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ All this talk about the NFL is getting me excited!  Who do you think will win it all?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think most people would say the New England Patriots will repeat with all their talent and their addition of Brandin Cooks, and I agree with those people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will be tough to beat, but I think the Atlanta Falcons are going to win it.  I think they are going to be hungry to redeem themselves.  Have you seen the new commercial with Matt Ryan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think they will be right there again at the end.  It should be an exciting season!  What other team are you expecting big things from?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Denver Broncos will have a bounce back season.  I like Trevor Siemian in year two and like a lot of their offseason moves."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree!  I love their acquisition of Jamaal Charles.  I think he feels like he has a lot left in the tank and wants to prove all the doubters wrong."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your pick for Most Valuable Player of the upcoming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Tom Brady again, especially with having Brandin Cooks to throw to.  They are going to make an amazing combination."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see 20 touchdowns between the two.  I see a second coming of the Tom Brady to Randy Moss connection of old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be great even though I'm not a New England Patriots fan.  I'll be rooting for the Miami Dolphins like usual."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a good ending to last season, hopefully they will pick up where they left off.  I think Tannehill will have a nice season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so for my happiness sakes!  I'm getting tired of the Patriots dominating the division.  I can't wait two months for the season to start!"
