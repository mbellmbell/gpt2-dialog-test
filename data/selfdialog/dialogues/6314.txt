"__STAR_WARS__ In Star Wars, I think Princess Leia didn't like wookies at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you think that? Everyone likes wookies because they're awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ At the end of A New Hope, she gave a medal to Han and Luke but Chewbaca didn't get a medal. Chewbaca had a big part in destroying the Death Star but no medal."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. I always wondered why Chewie didn't get a medal. He was even standing next to Han Solo and Luke Skywalker at the ceremony."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also in The Force Awakens when Rey and Chewbaca come back after Han Solo's death, Leia gives Rey a hug but not Chewbaca."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's interesting. Rey just met Han and didn't know him well but Chewbaca and been Han's best friend and partner for many years."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. Chewie was probably very upset over Han's death and Leia should know that but she just ignored Chewbaca and consoled Rey."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's possible that wookies have a different culture and express grief different than humans. Maybe hugging him would not be the correct thing to do."
"__STAR_WARS__ That still doesn't explain why he didn't get a medal in A New Hope."
"__STAR_WARS__ Poor Chewie. I hope that him and Rey can become great friends and adventure partners."
