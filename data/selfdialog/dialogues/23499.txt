"__DISNEY__ There's a Disney movie coming out in November I can't wait to see."
"__DISNEY__ What is it?"
"__DISNEY__ Thor:Ragnorak with Chris Hemsworth. Apparently a lot of other people like me can't wait to see it."
"__DISNEY__ Why? Are they all posting online or something?"
"__DISNEY__ They released a trailer of it, and the people who viewed the trailer in the first 24 hours broke the record for number of views in the first 24 hours for a Disney film."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, people must really want to see it. What movie was the previous record holder?"
"__DISNEY__ Beauty and the Beast. It had 127 million views, and Thor had 136 million views."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't think people would be that excited about a trailer for Thor."
"__DISNEY__ It was because a bunch of the Marvel creators were boasting about how this was going to be the best trailer ever, and it got the fans really curious."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder what the box office records will be when the film comes out in November?"
