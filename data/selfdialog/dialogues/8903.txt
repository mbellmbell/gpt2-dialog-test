"__BEATLES__ A lot of people think Ringo Star was a bad drummer"
"__BEATLES__ Over time, that has been proven to be wrong."
"__BEATLES__ How do you know that?"
"__BEATLES__ First of all,  before Ringo, drummers were measured by the drumming solo.  Ringo didn't do that."
"__BEATLES__ He always was just in the background"
"__BEATLES__ Not really.  What Ringo did was drum as an integral part of the song.  Like in the song, from the album Help, people said that they knew what song was going to be played just by a few measures of his drums."
"__BEATLES__ So he changed the role of the drummer by becoming one with the band"
"__BEATLES__ Except in the cases of the huge stadium concerts.  The screaming was so loud he could hear what the rest of the guys were singing"
"__BEATLES__ So what did he do?"
"__BEATLES__ He kept the beat going by watching how the other guys were wiggling their butts."
