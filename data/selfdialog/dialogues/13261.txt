"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is the worst franchise in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A few years ago I would have said the Raiders, but it has to be the Jags.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Small market problems?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah small problems and a college football state."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Titans are in Tennessee and that's a college football state."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it is, but in Florida you have The Gators, 'Noles and the 'Canes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you're right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In Tennessee you just have the Volunteers and their program is far from its past prominence."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you like Tebow?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he should have moved over to tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, have been saying that for years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, If you look at his skillset and physicality it's not prototypical NFL quarterback, it's Tight End."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So why didn't he?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a multi-million dollar question. I would say hubris."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, what is the best franchise?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's easy, the Patriots?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the 2nd best?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Has to be the Steelers. They do damage in the playoffs basically every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos have really come up though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes they have, but the Steelers have been up for a long time now and I doubt they will diminish anytime soon."
