"__MOVIES__ I saw you rented a movie from the library, what did you get?"
"__MOVIES__ I got the film 1776; I watch it every Fourth of July."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is it a Revolutionary War movie?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a musical about signing the Declaration of Independence."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting. Is it a recent film?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it came out back in 1972."
"__MOVIES__ Are there any actors I'd know in it?"
"__MOVIES__ William Daniels is in it."
"__MOVIES__ Who is that?"
"__MOVIES__ He played Mr. Feeny on Boy Meets World."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't know he could sing."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he plays John Adams."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds like it's probably not very historically accurate."
"__MOVIES__ Well they probably weren't singing all the time, but in one duet, many of the lyrics come from actual correspondence of John and Abigail Adams."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's very interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, It's a pretty good musical."
"__MOVIES__ Well I might give it a try sometime. Did it win any awards?"
"__MOVIES__ It was nominated for a Golden Globe."
"__MOVIES__ Well, enjoy watching it."
"__MOVIES__ Thanks, I will!"
