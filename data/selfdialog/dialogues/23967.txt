"__SUPERHERO__ Read any good comic books lately?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Personally, I'm not a fan of comics. Takes too long to get engrossed in the story, I prefer to watch superhero movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ Dude, you don't know what you're missing out on! There's so much stuff they miss out on in the movies."
"__SUPERHERO__ I get what you mean, but I think reading comic books is a little juvenile. It's more normal to go see a superhero movie instead."
"__SUPERHERO__ Juvenile? You're crazy man, some of the best superhero story arcs haven't even been covered in the movies!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, I'd rather watch a two hour Batman movie as opposed to spending hours reading comics and catching up on many years worth of story."
"__SUPERHERO__ You don't know what you're missing out on man, the movies are never as good as the comics. Look at the Daredevil movie with Ben Affleck, it was terrible."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, I agree with you on that, but the show on Netflix is way better."
"__SUPERHERO__ Well, I agree with you too! But honestly, give comic books a chance!"
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe if I had more free time, but for now, I'll stick to watching superheroes on the big screen."
