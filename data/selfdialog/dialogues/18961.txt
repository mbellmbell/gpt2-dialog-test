"__MOVIES__ Did you see Manchester by the Sea this year?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I didn't go to the movies to see it though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me neither. I watched it at home."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think it needs to be seen at the theater."
"__MOVIES__ So what did you think about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked it, but I didn't love it."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. For all the hype that it was getting, I expected a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I would have preferred to just see it without hearing the reviews first."
"__MOVIES__ Did you find it incredibly depressing?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it was sad, but not as depressing as I heard it was."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I thought that it was going to be tough to get through."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. I found myself able to still enjoy the movie without being hammered with sadness."
"__MOVIES__ So do you agree that Casey Affleck deserved the Best Actor Oscar for it?"
"__MOVIES__ He was good, but I've seen him as a good actor for a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he could have gotten the award for a lot of other roles he played."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like that is a common practice. The Oscars always wait to give someone the award, and try to make up for past mistakes."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah just like Martin Scorsese. He directed like ten great movies before they gave him his Oscar."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that example came to my mind as well."
"__MOVIES__ It probably all has to do with money and politics, and that makes me not want to watch the Oscars anymore."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. It kind of ruins the magic of the movies to think of all the money-makers behind the scenes."
