"__MOVIES__ Have you watched anything good recently?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watched Moana last night. It's on Netflix now!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? I shouldn't have bothered going to the theater and paying for it then!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everything comes to Netflix eventually."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ So much! I cried."
"__MOVIES__ I always cry during Disney movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. That one theme song was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, totally crying."
"__MOVIES__ What about you? See anything good recently?"
"__MOVIES__ I went to Wonder Woman last week."
"__MOVIES__ How was it? Over hyped?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I loved it. I particularly liked that they let the Amazons be visibly old. They were strong and sexy and fierce, but they didn't try to hide any wrinkles."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, I should check it out. Vote with my dollars, as it were."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely recommend."
"__MOVIES__ I so rarely GO to the movies though. They're so expensive here."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I definitely miss the matinee pricing that you can get outside of NYC."
"__MOVIES__ Right? I don't always want to pay $15 for a ticket."
"__MOVIES__ Remember dollar movies? Did your home town have those?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! If I was going to a movie, it was likely a dollar movie."
