"__FASHION__ Have you seen Dior's new fall campaign for 2017?"
"__FASHION__ No but I bet Jennifer Lawrence is in it."
"__FASHION__ You nailed it."
"__FASHION__ She has been a model for Dior for a little while now."
"__FASHION__ They say the Dior Fall 2017 collection by Maria Grazia Chiuri captures Jennifer Lawrence just as she is."
"__FASHION__ What does that mean?"
"__FASHION__ She's in a series of black and white photographs that were shot by some French photographer."
"__FASHION__ How do they look?"
"__FASHION__ She appears to be both elegant and relaxed in the pictures."
"__FASHION__ Like she isn't being posed."
"__FASHION__ Yeah. The clothing she is wearing in the photos are said to correspond to her own personal style."
"__FASHION__ What is she wearing in them?"
"__FASHION__ Jeans, t-shirt, a dark jacket, heels, some jewelry and a Dior handbag."
"__FASHION__ It could just be me but that doesn't sound like it would be pleasing to the eye."
"__FASHION__ If the jeans she was wearing in the pictures didn't look like they belonged on a man, I would have to say you're wrong."
"__FASHION__ But... I am not wrong am I? You didn't like the clothes she was wearing did you?"
"__FASHION__ No."
"__FASHION__ They should have had her wear clothes that were more feminine."
"__FASHION__ Exactly. Those pictures failed in every way to me."
"__FASHION__ That's not good."
