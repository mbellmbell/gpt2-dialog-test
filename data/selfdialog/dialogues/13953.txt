"__BASKETBALL__ Hey, did you watch the Warrior/Spurs game last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, not surprised to see the Warriors win again."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kevin Durant was on fire."
"__BASKETBALL__ He is amazing to watch as he can drive to the hoop or hit a 3 pointer."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who would you rather have on your team, James or Durant?"

"__BASKETBALL__ Crazy to see that Cleveland and Golden State are undefeated in the playoffs."
"__BASKETBALL__ Absolutely as they are both 10 and 0."
"__BASKETBALL__ Who do you thing will win the NBA title."
"__BASKETBALL__ I would put my money on Cleveland."
"__BASKETBALL__ I watched some of the Cleveland game the other night and I was just shocked to see how much James gets away with on the court."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know. I watched him run over a guy, take six steps, run over a second guy and dunk it with no foul called."
"__BASKETBALL__ Have you heard anything about the growth hormone James is supposedly taking?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Only that it builds muscle without going to the gym."

"__BASKETBALL__ What team do you think is on the verge of really getting good?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think my pick would be the Milwaukee Bucks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why do you think they are your guess."
