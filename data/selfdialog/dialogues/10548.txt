"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Ever heard of J. Cole?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The rapper? Yeah, but I'm not a fan."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why not?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I heard his song 'Work Out', and just didn't like it at all."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Don't let that one song influence your opinion of all his music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why? Is it different from that song?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Vastly different. He's actually very lyrical, almost like Tupac."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a very bold claim."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can back it up. Listen to 'Change' and 'High for Hours'. You'll understand."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I better not be disappointed."
