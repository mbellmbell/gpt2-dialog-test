"__MOVIES__ I really like the Disney Pixar movies. Do you have a favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ That is so tough. I think Finding Nemo though."
"__MOVIES__ That's great one."
"__MOVIES__ I remember thinking the concept was so dumb and not wanting to see it. I ended up seeing it three times in theatres!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess you really did like it then."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I did. The one that was kind of disappointing for me was Inside Out."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ I just thought the concept was amazing and so insightful. The movie ended up being kind of dry and boring."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was good."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't think it was terrible, I just thought they could have done so much more."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can see what you are saying. Was Wreck It Ralph Pixar too?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that was just a Disney one. Tangled, Bolt, Frozen and Moana were all the same way."
"__MOVIES__ That gets so confusing."
"__MOVIES__ I know. But they all end up being great movies."
"__MOVIES__ It sort of seems like the Pixar movies are the ones that aren't musicals."
"__MOVIES__ I think for the most part that is true. I can't think of any that are."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if that is on purpose."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. It could be."
"__MOVIES__ I just don't know how any other animation studio can compete."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Universal has some good animated movies don't they?"
