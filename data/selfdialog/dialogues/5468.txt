"__STAR_WARS__ What was the first Star Wars movie you saw in theaters?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I saw The Phantom Menace when it came out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? What was your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked Darth Maul, I thought his lightsabre was cool."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think we'll ever see another double-bladed lightsabre?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope not, it's cooler if he was the only one to ever have one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wish he hadn't died though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, too bad he couldn't have been the main villain for that series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if there's a book about him or anything."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe! We'll have to check."
