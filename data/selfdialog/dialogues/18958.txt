"__MOVIES__ Are you going to the showing of The Grateful Dead Movie next time they put it out in theaters."
"__MOVIES__ You bet, i missed it last time because of work.  Ive always wanted to see it on the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ I know its awesome.  I love the sound of it if you go to a good theater with a good sound system."
"__MOVIES__ Have they done the same thing with the other DVD's they've put out."
"__MOVIES__ No i don't believe so but that would be awesome, i would love to see truckin up to buffalo on the silver screen."
"__MOVIES__ Thats too bad.  Have you seen the new wolverine movie yet Logan?"
"__MOVIES__ Ya i did i thought it was pretty good, i definitely wasn't expecting the movie to go the way it did."
"__MOVIES__ I know i didn't read anything about the movie and just went and saw it.  All the death in it really surprised me."
"__MOVIES__ The R rating really surprised me too, i think it was the first comic book movie with an R rating."
"__MOVIES__ You might be right i cant remember if suicide came out before that or not.  I cant even think of any other R rated comic book movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither maybe one of the bat mans were but im pretty sure they are all pg-13."
"__MOVIES__ Nah im pretty sure they are all pg-13.  But do you think they are gonna replace wolverine with his clone daughter?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably, they need a new cash cow since they are retiring wolverine.  People will probably go just as crazy for her as they did for him."
"__MOVIES__ probably, besides i bet they'll try anything a couple of times.  Its hard to lose money on a comic book movie people will still see them even if they are terrible."
"__MOVIES__ thats true i remember all of my friends going to see electkra."
"__MOVIES__ O lord that was a terrible one, remember daredevil with ben affleck."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortuanitely i do remember that one, i cant believe they made him batman after his terrible performance in daredevil."
"__MOVIES__ Well he probably has a really good agent."
"__MOVIES__ I would imagine so.  But anyways nerve came in the mail today you want to come over and watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ Sure, doesn't that have julia roberts niece in it?"
