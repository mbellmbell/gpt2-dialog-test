"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did they before the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they have national championship for the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they didn't really have a national championship, per se. They had the National Football League and the American Football League"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had the championships individually?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's a little more complicated than that. The merger required some kind of championship."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When was the merger?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Merger was announced back in 1966, then they had their own seasons until 1969, and merged completely in 1970. That was the first superbowl season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the reson they merged?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They were competing aginst each other for college players, and the salaries went skyrocketing. They raided other conferences for players too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Always it comes down to money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, so once they merged under the same rules, the raids stopped, they still traded players, of course."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see. So the championbship between the leagues is basically what superbowl is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hm. I loved last years superbowl,. It was the biggest comeback win in history"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 25 points. That's Brady forya"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is amazing because he wasn't drafted until round 6, pick 199."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, pick 199 out of 254 players picked that year. There was a reddit post while back about his resume"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, yeah I saw that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was an intern at Merryl Lynch. Good thing patriots picked him up,. otherwise, we woulnd't have our second 5 times Superbowl Champion"
