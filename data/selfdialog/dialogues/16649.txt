"__MOVIES__ Do you think there will ever be another Harry Potter movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. Right now Rowling is busy with the Fantastic Beasts movies."
"__MOVIES__ I know originally it was only supposed to be a trilogy and then it changed to have five movies in the series instead."
"__MOVIES__ What about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Do you think that could be made into a movie?"
"__MOVIES__ From what I've heard, Warner Brothers has no plans of making it into a movie at this time."
"__MOVIES__ I'm hoping that once the Fantastic Beasts movies are done that Rowling might write another Harry Potter book."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I guess she could write one with the kids grown up and have it have something to do with their kids."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Remember when the kids were introduced at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she could take it from there."
"__MOVIES__ You know, Deathly Hallows 2 was my favorite movie from the series. I like how Harry defeated Voldemort and how it tied up all the story lines."
"__MOVIES__ My favorite was Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. It was fun getting an introduction to each of the characters."
"__MOVIES__ Who is your favorite character from the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Besides Harry? That would be Ron Weasley."
"__MOVIES__ He could be really funny. I ended up really liking Snape."
"__MOVIES__ How come?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, all this time I thought he was a bad guy, only to find out he was really a good guy after all."
"__MOVIES__ I was rather surprised by that, too."
"__MOVIES__ So, are you planing on seeing all of the Fantastic Beasts movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I am."
"__MOVIES__ I don't like them quite as much as the Harry Potter movies, but the first one was still pretty good."
