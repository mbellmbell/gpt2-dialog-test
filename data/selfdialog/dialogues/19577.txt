"__MOVIES__ I saw a Vin Diesel movie the other day and now I can't remember what it was."
"__MOVIES__ Do I need to help jog your memory?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, please do."
"__MOVIES__ Okay.  Did it have cars in it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was not a Fast and the Furious movie if that's what you're getting at."
"__MOVIES__ Okay.  Was he an action hero star."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of.  He had special abilities."
"__MOVIES__ Was it the newer XXX movie that came out?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he was a guy who couldn't be killed and hunted witches."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, you're talking about The Last Witch Hunter."
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  That's the one.  I kind of feel dumb now since the title was a dead giveaway."
"__MOVIES__ That was a surprisingly good movie.  Critics hated it, I didn't."
"__MOVIES__ It had some good setpieces.  And I love me some Michael Caine."
"__MOVIES__ I actually liked how Elijah Wood ended up being a bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a good twist and out of character for him."
"__MOVIES__ It was a bit odd how the Witch Hunter had so much money."
"__MOVIES__ You mean how we drove around a super nice car?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  You would think he would keep a lower profile."
"__MOVIES__ I get it.  Maybe they should have got him a Honda Accord instead."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  But they could still make it black to get some coolness."
