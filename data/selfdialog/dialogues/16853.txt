"__MOVIES__ Are you a fan of David Lynch."
"__MOVIES__ Love him. Love him so, so, so much."
"__MOVIES__ I'm just getting into him and I just saw Mulholland Street."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, Mulholland Drive, actually. It's a remarkable film."
"__MOVIES__ I really loved it. So surreal and so eerie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's David Lynch for ya."
"__MOVIES__ What should I watch next?"
"__MOVIES__ Twin Peaks, his television show. A new season just came out!"
"__MOVIES__ Really, what channel is it on?"
"__MOVIES__ It's on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, that sounds like a huge investment of time though. I want to watch one of his movies tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Do you want something really experimental or only sort of experimental?"
"__MOVIES__ Um, I guess sort of experimental. Give me whatever is most accessible of his."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you should watch Blue Velvet tonight."
"__MOVIES__ Blue Velvet, huh? Anyone I might know who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Laura Dern, Dennis Hopper, Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I know Dennis Hopper and Laura Dern. What do the critics make of it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a really contentious one. Love/hate relationship, I know Ebert was one of the major dissenters who thought the film sucked."
"__MOVIES__ Oy, I normally trust Ebert."
"__MOVIES__ Same, but I think he's wrong on this one!"
