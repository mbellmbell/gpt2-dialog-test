"__BASEBALL__ Hey are you here I am at Wrigley field?"
"__BASEBALL__ Shame I won't be making it to the game today."
"__BASEBALL__ Awww you won't?"
"__BASEBALL__ Nah I can't my boss will not let me off early"
"__BASEBALL__ Are you gonna be able to catch the game at all?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah I will try to watch it in the office"
"__BASEBALL__ Your boss won't mind that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure he won't as he always does."
"__BASEBALL__ Bave a good time and let's talk about the players while we wait."
"__BASEBALL__ Rodgers is who is on my mind he is awful its like he cannot hit anything five feet in front of eyes."
"__BASEBALL__ I know right? Its like he is a bat or something"
"__BASEBALL__ I think a bat would be giving him to much credit."
"__BASEBALL__ You see carter stats though?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are almost high enough he will beat the records from like the 50s."
"__BASEBALL__ The records are that old geeze."
"__BASEBALL__ Most of the new players are nowhere near as good as the old ones."
"__BASEBALL__ I would not go quite as far as that some of them are quite good."
"__BASEBALL__ But they are not as good precisely."
"__BASEBALL__ Let's agree to disagree but I gotta go the games about to start"
"__BASEBALL__ Well have a good one hopefully I see you on the tube."
