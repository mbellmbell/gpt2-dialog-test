"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate how long the off season is for football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's only a few weeks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ a few weeks too long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, your favorites probably enjoy the off season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would they? They love playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So that they can rest up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do they need rest for?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ for injuries they get while playing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess that's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also probably like spending time with their families."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't think about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you still think the off season is too long?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I see why it's necessary at least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's come progress."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not saying they don't deserve time off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What are you saying then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm just saying that I love football, and I miss watching it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I miss it too, buddy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We could always watch some old games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah! Let's do it."
