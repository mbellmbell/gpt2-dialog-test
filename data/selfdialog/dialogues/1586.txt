"__MUSIC__ Music sure has changed these days."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I mean everything has gone electronic."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, even old bands are doing it now."
"__MUSIC__ Anything to stay relevant I guess."
"__MUSIC__ Well, alternative artists aren't really going down that path."
"__MUSIC__ Yea I guess I should be thankful for that."
"__MUSIC__ Could you image Blink 182 auto-tuning themselves?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that would be so horrible."
"__MUSIC__ Or what if Green Day started doing it?"
"__MUSIC__ Man, I'd be so disappointed in them."
"__MUSIC__ Music has just gotten extremely commercial."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, it really is all about the money."
"__MUSIC__ On the positive side, musicians are still at least pretending to be legitimate artists."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that a positive thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Because it means people still care about legitmacy."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. But how long do you think that will last."
"__MUSIC__ Probably a couple more generations."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, and then people won't even care."
"__MUSIC__ Yea, they'll just download an ap that sings to them."
