"__BEATLES__ Hey do you like the Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah I love them, and so do most of my friends"
"__BEATLES__ Who is your favorite member? I think mine is Paul but I haven't really made up my mind"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah I like Paul and John, but I think George was the most underrated, unless you count Ringo"
"__BEATLES__ No one ever counts Ringo, it seems like"
"__BEATLES__ They finally inducted him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, though, so that's cool"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, I really liked Octopus's Garden that he wrote with George"
"__BEATLES__ That's a great song, just like Yellow Submarine, which is a classic"
"__BEATLES__ People don't give Ringo enough credit for his drumming, either"
"__BEATLES__ Oh yes, he's one of the greatest drummers of all time, no question"
