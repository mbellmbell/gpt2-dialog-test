"__MOVIES__ So, it seems the Transformers movie franchise continues, eh?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. They've churned out a number of them."
"__MOVIES__ That same actor has been in a couple of the films."
"__MOVIES__ Are you talking about Mark Wahlberg?"
"__MOVIES__ That's him. Was there another main actor that did a Transformers movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, yes. There were three live-action Transformers movies in theatres before Wahlberg."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow. I didn't realize there had been that many!"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. There has been one every two or three years since 2007."
"__MOVIES__ Who starred in the movies without Mark Wahlberg?"
"__MOVIES__ Shia LaBeouf was the main actor for the first three movies."
"__MOVIES__ That rings a bell. Were those movies as good as the more recent ones?"
"__MOVIES__ I would say they probably were. They were all Michael Bay films."
"__MOVIES__ Who is Michael Bay?"
"__MOVIES__ You don't know who Michael Bay is? He is a widely recognized director that has done Transformers and some other popular movies."
"__MOVIES__ Okay. I've probably seen some of this stuff, then."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see Armageddon, Pearl Harbor or The Rock?"
"__MOVIES__ I know I saw Armageddon, and I think I saw Pearl Harbor."
"__MOVIES__ Well, those were Michael Bay films."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I see. Which movie was The Rock?"
"__MOVIES__ That was that one about escaping from Alcatraz, with Sean Connery and Nick Cage."
