"__MOVIES__ I just saw the new Pirate of the Caribbean movie."
"__MOVIES__ How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely entertaining. Followed the formula for the other movies of the series, but was fun nonetheless."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that there were some of the actors from previous movies in it from previous movies in the series."
"__MOVIES__ Well, Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow of course and Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were also in it for a little bit."
"__MOVIES__ Didn't Orlando Bloom's character die in one of the movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he didn't actually die, but he was banished to guard Davy Jones' locker. The plot of this movie was his son's attempt to free him from this  curse."
"__MOVIES__ I suppose he succeeded?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course!"
"__MOVIES__ We're the special effects pretty good?"
"__MOVIES__ They were. I also thought the stunt work was pretty spectacular."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how much of his stunt work Johnny Depp actually does."
"__MOVIES__ No idea, but I do know that he or Disney said this would probably be the last movie in the series.I'm not sure I buy that."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you stay until all the credits run, there's a scene that is a perfect lead-in to another movie. Most people won't know it even exists if they take off before the credits are done."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. I'll be sure to stay and see it."
"__MOVIES__ Plus the movie is doing well at the box office. If Disney thinks they can make money, they'll surely make another movie."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you there."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I just remembered...Paul McCartney had a cameo appearance in the movie. I didn't even recognize him!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure he had a cameo in a previous movie in the series, but I don't remember which one."
