"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good morning."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Good morning, how are you doing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Pretty good, been a busy week."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too, I'm ready for the weekend."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I hear that, what are your plans this weekend?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nothing really, I want to stay home and watch tv."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Sounds like great plans, there's a Indiana Jones marathon on this weekend."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Nice, which channel?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The Starz channel. I might watch it myself."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ We can text each other while watching it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, like a long distance movie date!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It would be great if there was a Star Wars Marathon too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Harrison Ford overload would be fun!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes, he was such a good actor in his prime."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ For sure, I wonder how rich he is?!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Probably loaded, just between those two movie series he had to make a killing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ We should google it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok, I just did and it says net worth of $230 million."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I was expecting more, but that's still quite a bit."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money."
