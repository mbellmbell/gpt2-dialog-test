"__MOVIES__ Did you see Christian Bale in the Prestige?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes , he was great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree he was great but did his character, Borden have a twin or did he clone himself?"
"__MOVIES__ He had a twin."
"__MOVIES__ Then why did Borden send Angier to Tesla?"
"__MOVIES__ It was just a trick, to fool Angier."
"__MOVIES__ How did Borden know Tesla had the machine to clone people?"
"__MOVIES__ He didn't, even Tesla wasn't sure what the machine was or how it worked."
"__MOVIES__ So, it was all just a coincidence?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was. Borden was just trying to send Angier away to the States."
"__MOVIES__ I see. I didn't think they's make storyline so ambigious."
"__MOVIES__ It's not, it adds to the mystery. The whole movie is really well thought out."
"__MOVIES__ It was hard to see Christian Bale cut off his own thumb."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't like seeing the canary get killed."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither, but it illustrates a good point about how the magic tricks work."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Just like how Christian Bale cut off his thumb, it's all just an illusion."
"__MOVIES__ Right, like the magician who pretended to be elderly so he could make it seem like he was levitating the fish bowl."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. It's all about appearances."
"__MOVIES__ That movie was a good one."
