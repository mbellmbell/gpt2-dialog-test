"__BASKETBALL__ You're telling me that a healthy San Antonio or Houston couldn't at least make the series competitive?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Houston vs. the Cavs would have been a great series, they battled every time they played."
"__BASKETBALL__ Cavs fans will be in for a rude awakening when they get to the finals and realize that the Warriors aren't the Celtics."
"__BASKETBALL__ All I'm saying is that the Warriors aren't going to leave Kyle Korver open for 3 every possession."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs are way too explosive in offense!! Before the series I thought it'll be Cavs at 5 but now it is clear it will be over after 4 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ The celtics are not ready yet and i think no one can doubt it. There are obvious lags in rebounding."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Celtics need to draft Fultz and move Thomas while his stock is high."
"__BASKETBALL__ But can you imagine Fultz AND Thomas together?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The NBA is way to predictable. They need to implement a hard cap with no luxury tax."
"__BASKETBALL__ Your right, Spread the talent around create parity and make the NBA competitive."
"__BASKETBALL__ The thing that kills me is that Cleveland fans forgets that Lebron abandon them to win a ring with another team."
"__BASKETBALL__ Jordan, Kobe, Duncan, Pierce NEVER abandon their teams to win a title..THEY played against the BEST because they wanted to be known as the BEST."
"__BASKETBALL__ As much as I love the NBA I'm starting to find the games unwatchable. There's just no competition."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree, but I will still continue to watch....I just hope they make some changes."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know its based on the record but HOW was Boston a #1 seed."
"__BASKETBALL__ A #1 seed should NEVER lose by 50 points....that just isn't fathomable."
"__BASKETBALL__ Celtics are nowhere near as talented as the elite teams, yet accomplished a lot."
"__BASKETBALL__ Of course though, no respect is given. Wait till we see who they draft."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Celtics already got what they wanted this season: Got a first seed, Made it to conference finals and got the first pick in the draft."
"__BASKETBALL__ I would say this was a success, the only thing better would be a ring."
