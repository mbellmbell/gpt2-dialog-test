"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can you believe it - the new NFL season is almost here."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I know. I love this time of the year...camps, signings, trades, new players...its all great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your pre-season super bowl favorite?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I have to go with my AFC team - the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever - that's an easy no-brainer pick.  But they are a great team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am fortunate to live in New England where its safe to love the Pats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah - no matter where you live though you have to acknowledge excellence - Brady and Bellichek - doesnt get much better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree and am thankful they are on my team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I appreciate how great they are and yet my team the Broncos are probably their biggest rivals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree they are - mainly because they are also good and play well every year and the game outcome is always up for grabs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not like the Bills or Jets - they are welcome mats - terrible and could never be called - a rivalry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree I think for it to be a rivalry in the NFL - the teams must be on par - performance wise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree back in the day when the Raiders were great - the rivalry couldn't get bigger than Broncos-Raiders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Players hated each other, fans hated each other, coaches hated each other. the good old days!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right and then the Raiders stunk it up... were terrible for the last 10-15 years and the Broncos moved on."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Add in the free agency thing and its no longer a league that has rivalries in the true sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Over all its ok though. I for one prefer the rivalry based upon competition, good play and outcome up for grabs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, but I miss the old my team above all and loyalty now and then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of loyalty - Do you think Bellichek will trade Gronk this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see how he could - despite injuries..Brady likes him and relies on him,"
