"__MOVIES__ Rogue One: A Star Wars Story just came out on Blu-Ray and streaming.  Did you see it?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it at the movie theater, and will definitely see it again online."
"__MOVIES__ It's amazing how Tarkin and Leah were completely generated by CG."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't realize it until I read about it online.  It's sad that Carrie Fisher passed away right after the movie was released."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure it was devastating news for a generation of Star Wars fans."
"__MOVIES__ It's a good thing that she had already finished filming her parts for the upcoming Episode 8 movie."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, the 'Last Jedi'!  It's coming out in December, right?  Did you see the teaser trailer?"
"__MOVIES__ I saw it a few weeks ago. It was just a teaser but I am already excited nonetheless!!"
"__MOVIES__ Disney announced that they will be making Star Wars films at least through 2030!"
"__MOVIES__ What! You mean the story is going to continue past this current trilogy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it opens up the possibility for a whole new trilogy after Episode 9."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that totally lessens the importance of these next two movies....like there is no finality.  I wish they didn't announce that."
"__MOVIES__ It should keep this current generation of new Star Wars fans in the loop and maybe a whole new generation in 10 years."
"__MOVIES__ So by the time the final movie comes out in 2030 or so, it would be more than 50 years since the first movie!"
"__MOVIES__ That's so crazy! But I guess it goes to show how the first Star Wars movie completely revolutionized film making at the time."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Even though it's somewhat dated now, there are parts of it that are still fresh and relevant today."
"__MOVIES__ I sometimes watch parts of it whenever it's re-run on TV, and often find myself noticing new things about it, every time."
"__MOVIES__ It's amazing how most of the first three films are not CG!  They are almost all live action, with miniatures and clever effects."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it should teach filmmakers today a lot of lessons about not becoming so reliant on CG."
"__MOVIES__ So, the next movie comes out by the end of the year....I can't wait!!"
