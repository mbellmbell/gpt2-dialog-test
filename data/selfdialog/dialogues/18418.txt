"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you know that they have a sequel to Finding Nemo?"
"__MOVIES__ No, are you serious?  How did I miss that?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, it's been advertised everywhere."
"__MOVIES__ So what's it called?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called Finding Dory and it features Dory, the fish from Nemo!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh are you serious!  That's precious!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a total must see.  I wouldn't say it's quite as good as the original, but it's definitely close."
"__MOVIES__ So what is the storyline?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Dory is looking for her family in the movie.  She has lost them and she wants to reconnect."
"__MOVIES__ Is it chronologically taking place after the Nemo movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it is.  So she enlists the help of Nemo and others to find her family."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds so sweet!  Is it as funny as the original?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'd say it's nearly as funny and definitely just as heartwarming."
"__MOVIES__ I'm going to have to check that out.  I thought Finding Nemo was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it truly was amazing, and it was made over ten years ago!  It took them forever to make a sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Well I wouldn't have expected a sequel to that movie."
"__MOVIES__ No, I was surprised too.  It was a pleasant surprise though."
"__MOVIES__ Well I will definitely check it out.  Is Nemo's dad in it too?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely, it has his dad and there are a bunch of funny new characters too like this octopus you'll really like."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great.  I can't wait to see it!"
