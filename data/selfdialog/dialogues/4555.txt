"__MUSIC__ I can't wait for the new Tool album. It's been years!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? I haven't heard from them in a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they haven't released a new album in over a decade."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, over a decade? Did they break up?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not officially. They've just taken their time making a new album!"
"__MUSIC__ What was their last album? Lateralus?"
"__MUSIC__ No, 10,000 Days. It was released in 2005."
"__MUSIC__ So they have a new album coming out soon?"
"__MUSIC__ Hopefully. They haven't officially announced anything soon."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, really? So there might not be a new album?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe not. But there's evidence that there will be."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of evidence?"
"__MUSIC__ I've heard reports that they've been in the studio, and that their singer has started recording vocals."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds promising. I assume they're not touring then."
"__MUSIC__ No, they've been playing a few shows here and there."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, wow. Have they been playing new material."
"__MUSIC__ Not exactly. Mostly they've been playing old songs."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound good. I wonder if they actually will come out with a new album."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know for sure, but I'm excited by the prospect."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Thanks for letting me know!"
