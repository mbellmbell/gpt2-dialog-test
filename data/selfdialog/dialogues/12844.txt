"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you watch the Super Bowl last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I watch it every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you think about it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's definitely the best comeback I've ever seen in a Super Bowl, and maybe in any football game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was really crazy wasn't it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I still can't believe it happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Falcons will never get over that. They completely fell apart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet a lot of people stopped watching the game around the 3rd quarter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought about it. I kept watching mainly to see the commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a good thing you stuck around!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know! I'm so glad I got to see the whole game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think that game solidified Tom Brady as the best quarterback ever?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I do. He was already amazing, but that game put him over the top."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who is on your Mount Rushmore of quarterbacks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have Brady, Montana, Elway, and Bradshaw."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bradshaw is an interesting choice. You don't hear him being mentioned all that often."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ People forget how good he was. I think it might be because he's a goofy TV personality now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, and Steve Young."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a shame that Marino never won a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know. But I don't hold that against him. He's still one of the best ever."
