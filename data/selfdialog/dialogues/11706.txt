"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Cowboys are going to be underwhelming this year. What do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree. I think once some teams have expectations, they seem to fold under the pressure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I think Dak Prescott is going to be a one year wonder."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't go that far. But they did over achieve last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so because other teams will now know how to prepar for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But if he's good, does it matter?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it does since he's not really anything new that the NFL has never seen before."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think he's pretty good. He has good speed and knows how to operate from the pocket."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's because the Cowboys have an elite offensive line. Without that line, Prescott would be in trouble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he's still going to have that line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that other teams are going to figure out how to exploit that line and get to Dak Prescott."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ On the flip side, you also have to think that he's going to figure things out better in his second year as the starting quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. I just think that the pressure is going to get to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's definitely something we can see from a quarterback entering his second year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think some of the Cowboys players have had some trouble with the law, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I heard that. But I'm not too sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't think any of them were significant role players on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They mustn't have been considering I would have see articles about it online."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it does seem like a case of the Cowboys acting like the Cowboys again when it comes to getting in trouble with the law."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's never a good thing when your team has expectations now."
