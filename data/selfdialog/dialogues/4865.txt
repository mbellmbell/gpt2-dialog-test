"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you like Tom Petty?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I can't stand his music!  He has always been popular but I never saw the appeal."
"__MUSIC__ Me either!  To me he sounds whiny and his music is bland."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it really is.  Free Fallin' really gets on my nerves."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  And that Last Dance with MaryJane song is downright creepy if you watch the video."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I agree.  I can't believe he was so big back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ I have no idea.  There are a lot of bad artists that get popular, though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's true.  I could name many."
"__MUSIC__ Like Eminem?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I wasn't even thinking about hip-hop artists but if you include them the list gets longer."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I guess variety is good.  Different people have different tastes."
"__MUSIC__ I love Tim McGraw.  He has always had great songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Kenney Chesney."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  They're both great country artists."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know you listen to country music."
"__MUSIC__ I just recently started.  My husband is the one who introduced me to it."
"__MUSIC__ Well there's a lot of good country out there.  You'll have to check out Blake Shelton."
"__MUSIC__ Well of course I already have.  He's one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he has great music and great videos, too."
"__MUSIC__ I love it when there's a good video to go along with the song."
