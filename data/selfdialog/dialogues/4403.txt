"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite genre of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Death metal is my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that like 'screamo' yelling music that sounds like guttural noises and barking?  How can you listen to that?"
"__MUSIC__ I agree the vocal are a little ridiculous but I actually listen to it for the instruments."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, death metal is the most demanding genre of music so it requires more skilled musicians."
"__MUSIC__ Ha!  I doubt that!"
"__MUSIC__ Really!  Most accomplished death metal players are also able to play lower forms of music like country, rock, slow jams, and so on."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.  Can you recommend someone?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, Jon 5 is an amazing guitar player to spans several genres.  He's know for being in Marilyn Manson but his solo work includes diverse playing styles; even 'chicken pickin!'"
"__MUSIC__ Ok, I can be open to that.  What about the weirder side of these groups.  Aren't they controversial."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but that's not what attracted me to them."
"__MUSIC__ What did make you interested?"
"__MUSIC__ Most people think it's parental or societal rebellion but, for me, it's just the skill of the players."
"__MUSIC__ Have you been to any concerns?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course!"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite part?"
"__MUSIC__ As a female, I love the long hair of the male musicians.  Long hair is very common among metal heads but greasy hair is a no go!"
"__MUSIC__ Ha!  I totally agree.  But, are there even many death metal shows that come through our area?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah!  It's more common than you'd think.  Probably at least 1 tour every month.  Here, I'll show you some upcoming concerns in our area."
