"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the best team to never win a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely the 1998 Minnesota Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what comes to my mind as well. The 1999 Jacksonville Jaguars come to mind as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And the 2007 New England Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I forgot all about New England. They've won so much, that I don't really think about them in this category."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. The 1998 Minnesota Vikings were destined to win and then something happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Gary Anderson happened."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The dude was perfect all year and missed the biggest kick in Vikings history."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He probably can't sleep till this day. It was only a 40 yarder, in the dome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So much talent wasted on not winning the Super Bowl. Cunningham, Randy Moss, Cris Carter, Robert Smith. That offense was ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ridiculous was right. Everyone wanted to see the Vikings and Broncos in that Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everyone, including me. What could have been."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if Minnesota could have beaten Denver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They would have put up a better showing than Atlanta. You mentioned the 1999 Jaguars. What happened with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They went 14-0 against everyone in the league except the Titans. They went 0-3 against them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, the Music City Miracle titans. Yes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They had a pretty solid offense and defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm trying to think. Brunnell, Fred Taylor, Jimmy Smith."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. Quite a balanced offense. The defense wasn't too bad either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the Titans gave us one of the best Super Bowls that year against the Rams. So, not so disappointed Jacksonville didn't make it."
