"__MUSIC__ Why do you think people like the Beatles?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I can't stand them."
"__MUSIC__ I think it must be a nostalgia thing."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's just baby boomers telling us what to like and not like."
"__MUSIC__ That music is annoying cheery."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of the lyrics are stupid and overly simple."
"__MUSIC__ It's not like the Rolling Stones!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they were way cooler."
"__MUSIC__ All you have to say is Mick Jagger vs Paul McCartney....."
"__MUSIC__ I know, right?! You can't get any cooler than Wild Horses by the Stones."
"__MUSIC__ I saw them in concert. Satisfaction gets my vote."
"__MUSIC__ Dude that is old school. They are still going!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Keith and Mick got to be 100!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but they can still wear skinny pants and rock out."
"__MUSIC__ It's got to be an expensive concert to go to....it was super expensive."
"__MUSIC__ I bet. I'm not sure I like them that much."
"__MUSIC__ It was totally worth it. They really rock out."
"__MUSIC__ Even if the Beatles were still around, they couldn't touch the Stones."
"__MUSIC__ Heck no! Stones rule, Beatles drool!"
"__MUSIC__ Even the Stone's album last year was rockin'!"
