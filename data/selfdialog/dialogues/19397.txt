"__MOVIES__ So have you seen any movies you can suggest?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, actually!  I just saw a movie called Daddy's Home."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I heard about that.  How as it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was really funny!"
"__MOVIES__ Who was in that again?"
"__MOVIES__ Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were the stars."
"__MOVIES__ They're both great actors!  Will Ferrell is hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ He sure is!  Mark Wahlberg was really funny too?"
"__MOVIES__ I had no idea!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, he has been in a few comedies now."
"__MOVIES__ What was the one with the teddy bear called?"
"__MOVIES__ Ted.  Daddy's Home was even better!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Ted was a little cheesy for me.  I couldn't get past the talking bear concept."
"__MOVIES__ I agree it was a bit much.  Daddy's Home was a little more realistic."
"__MOVIES__ Still off the wall though, I imagine?"
"__MOVIES__ A little.  But it's definitely worth watching."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't there a sequel coming out?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it will be in theaters later this year."
