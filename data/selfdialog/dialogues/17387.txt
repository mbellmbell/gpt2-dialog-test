"__MOVIES__ I really want to see the new Wonder Woman movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I am not a fan of superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ What? Are you insane?"
"__MOVIES__ They have just never interested me."
"__MOVIES__ Don't tell me that you didn't like Christian Bale as Batman."
"__MOVIES__ Eh. He was okay."
"__MOVIES__ What about Tobey Maguire as Spiderman?"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't watch the Spiderman movies if you paid me."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, last time. What about Chris Evans as Captain America?"
"__MOVIES__ Hm. I don't think I've ever watched any of those."
"__MOVIES__ There's still a chance that I can change your mind about superhero movies, then."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't think so."
"__MOVIES__ Fine. What is your favorite movie genre?"
"__MOVIES__ I love dramas."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously? Those are so boring."
"__MOVIES__ No way. Seeing the vast range of human emotion displayed on screen is amazing."
"__MOVIES__ Okay okay. What movies would you recommend?"
"__MOVIES__ I would recommend The Help. It is very dramatic, but there are also some very funny scenes throughout."
"__MOVIES__ That's the movie with Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis, right?"
"__MOVIES__ That's right. Octavia won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for that film."
