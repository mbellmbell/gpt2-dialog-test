"__HARRY_POTTER__ So I've read all the Harry Potter books, and now I want to watch the films. Are they any good?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I really loved the first three, but then they kind of taper off."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I can't wait to see what they did with Hogwartz and everything."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Chris Columbus directed the first film, and it's really good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I hope they didn't change too much."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They were actually really faithful to the original series. Who was your favorite character?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, Harry of course. I can't believe how mean his parents were to him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well yeah, but you know they weren't really his parents."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They acted like total ghouls to him!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know. I think they were afraid of his powers."
