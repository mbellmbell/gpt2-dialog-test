"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey man, who do you think is the best receiver in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man that's tough there's some good ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh man that's tough there's some good ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think I got it down to Bryant, AJ Green, Julio Jones, and Beckham."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think those are all good, I take AJ Green out though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think those are all good, Id take AJ Green out though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not AJ Green?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not AJ Green?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's really good, I just don't think he offers some skills such as running after the catch, like the other guys do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he's really good, I just don't think he offers some skills such as running after the catch, like the other guys do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Julio Jones can be a stud, but sometimes I think his hands are a little bit suspect."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but he's such a force physically."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Beckham might have the best hands of the bunch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd  he has the most talented hands, but not the best hands."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I guess he does seem to drop a lot of easy balls."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, really I think that does leave those bryant as the best receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I hate to say that because he's a cowboy though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I hate acknowledging that any cowboy is good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their fans are just so annoying."
