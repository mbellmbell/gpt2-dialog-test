"__MUSIC__ Jonny, have you figured out the end of that riff yet?"
"__MUSIC__ No, Butch.  I haven't.  Give me some time.  It's  getting there."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you're holding us all up ya' know.  We can't get this song cut till we got that right."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I'm working on it.  Nothing seems to click right with it.  I can't get the sound right."
"__MUSIC__ Should we start playing the song from the beginning again.  Perhaps that will inspire you a bit."
"__MUSIC__ No, I know how that song goes.  I just can't get those last three cords right.  I'll get it down."
"__MUSIC__ Hope so, it's costing us money just sitting here waiting to lay down this track."
"__MUSIC__ Well, you pushing me doesn't help.  Why don't you re-lay the vocals on the chorus while I'm getting this down.  That's save some time."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, but you'll have to go out into the hall to practice then and you will either be unplugged or have to drag an amp out there."
"__MUSIC__ Great.  I have to be plugged in.  It's the bending of the E string that I'm having the issue with.  You know, you heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I know.  Well if I played guitar I'd show you how to do it."
"__MUSIC__ Just stick to vocals Butch, it's what you do best.  Maybe grab your tambourine if you want something to do with your hands."
"__MUSIC__ All right.  No need to get testy.  I'll get Lisa and we'll go over the chorus and leave you to practicing."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, I'll get it soon.  Then we can give a couple runs through before we end for the night."
"__MUSIC__ Ok.  do you got the rest of the song down?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure do.  And I've learned Drive Alive from the live version of Freedom's new album."
"__MUSIC__ Really, great.  That's a good version too.  Alex goes way out there on the vocals on that one."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I was thinking about you when I decided to learn it.  It's a killer song."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah.  I can't wait to let Lisa know.  She can do a solo in that one."
"__MUSIC__ All right.  I'm going out in the hall then to practice.  Help me plugging in an amp will ya."
