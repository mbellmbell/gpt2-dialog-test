"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite type of music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like lots of different music. If I have to choose, I would probably say jazz."
"__MUSIC__ That's interesting. What kind of jazz?"
"__MUSIC__ I really like the old vocal jazz like Frank Sinatra and Billie Holiday."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I love Billie Holiday. She had such a soulful voice."
"__MUSIC__ She is one of my favorite jazz artists. I love listening to bluesy jazz when I am feeling down."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of modern artists who sing the classic jazz songs?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Michael Buble does a decent job. His version of Come Fly With Me is really great."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have heard him sing that."
"__MUSIC__ Well it's the title track on his first live album. You should check it out sometime."
"__MUSIC__ I love live jazz albums. They sound so much better than the studio versions."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I would love to see him live in concert one day."
"__MUSIC__ Jazz concerts are really fun. I think it is better to hear jazz in person."
"__MUSIC__ I think the band and the vocalists get to improvise and have more fun in front of an audience. It's a more fun experience."
"__MUSIC__ I have heard the original version of Come Fly With Me on a live album and it was spectacular."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that's because Frank Sinatra was spectacular. He was great at interacting with the audience."
"__MUSIC__ I think Come Fly With Me was one of his signature songs. It's hard to compare his version to anyone else's."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but in jazz, people sing other people's songs all the time. Everyone adds their own little touches to it."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. It think it depends on your personal preference."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, scatting and improvisations can also make a difference."
