"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think the Empire in the Star Wars movies ever learns anything?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not sure what you mean by that.    Please explain."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, they have built two Death Stars, and a third in The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was a Star Killer, not a Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, aren't the two weapons functionally similar?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I guess so, with the latter just being bigger."
"__STAR_WARS__ So they build them, but there is always some minor flaw that can be found in the plans."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly!    You would think they would have some better encryption."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe not even that complicated.     Just add a virus into any set of digital plans."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be evil.      Automatically disable any droid's operating system!"
