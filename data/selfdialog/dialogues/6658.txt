"__STAR_WARS__ So any theories about the Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I think we'll learn more about Snoke and what he is trying to do."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, Snoke doesn't seem to be following the Sith traditions, but trying to create a new Dark Side tradition."
"__STAR_WARS__ So, he looked back and saw flaws in the Sith."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it be hard not to, the Sith went from a dominate galactic power to an obscure cult with only two members at a time."
"__STAR_WARS__ So Snoke is avoiding the classic defintion of insanity, off doing the smae thing over and over and expecting a different result."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, he seems to be trying to create a Dark Side tradition as strong as the SIth, but with more self-discipline."
"__STAR_WARS__ So basically, same evil power, but less moustache twirling and ego mania?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Basically, yes."
