"__MOVIES__ Yes, although it was even more violent."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, well...that's Tarentino all right!"
"__MOVIES__ I loved the photography in this one. What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, I think Pulp Fiction had better photography. But Hateful 8 had wonderful scenery."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Pulp Fiction was a bit gritty in the scenery department."
"__MOVIES__ What do you think his next movie will be about?"
"__MOVIES__ Possibly something set in Europe."
"__MOVIES__ Wow! I would love to see that. Tarentino and Euro-trash."
"__MOVIES__ Especially at this time in history, it would be a great setting, what with the rise of Populism and the shaky European Union."
"__MOVIES__ Tarentino never shrinks from controversy and veiled political commentary."
"__MOVIES__ And wouldn't Uma Thurman be perfect as a populist candidate in Germany, for instance?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. Tarentino has said she is his muse. What an interesting actress..actor."
"__MOVIES__ I love movies, just in general. I love the experience of being in the theater, watching the big screen."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, hope it doesn't bite the dust because of all the online and TV options now."
"__MOVIES__ So much has changed about movies already. i was thinking about black and white movies just lately."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, we never see black and white these days. Remember 'On the Waterfront' and 'Streetcar Named Desire?'"
"__MOVIES__ Beautiful old movies. Not to mention 'Blue Angel' and 'My Little Chickadee.'"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think that it's more expensive now to do black and white?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. But I guess it's prohibitively expensive to use actual film now."
"__MOVIES__ Sigh. Movies now are great, but so were the old movies."
