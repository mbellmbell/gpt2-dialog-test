"__HARRY_POTTER__ I've always wondered why the Dursley's were always so terrible to Harry, any idea?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, they never wanted to take him in so there's that."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, but still, even if you don't want to do it, you don't need to treat him that way."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it always seemed like Dumbledore kind of forced them to keep him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, I know."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, it makes some sense, they are forced to keep someone that represents magic in their house, of course they'll hate him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ So, Harry deserves to be miserable the entire time?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He doesn't deserve it, but where else could he go and be safe"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm sure a million places, like the Weasleys?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, he could, but remember the protective spell requires him to go back to the Dursley's house once a summer."
