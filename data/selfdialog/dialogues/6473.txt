"__STAR_WARS__ You know what is so cool about the Star Wars franchise?"
"__STAR_WARS__ A whole bunch of stuff makes it cool!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but it connects a bunch of generations."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, some movies came out when my dad was a kid, and then when I was, and now when my kid grows up he will have some too."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is pretty cool.  I still think the original ones are the best though.  Return of the Jedi is great!"
"__STAR_WARS__ The Force Awakens was pretty good too though. It felt like the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ It did have that same kind of quality.  Daisy Ridley was really good in it."
"__STAR_WARS__ David Boyega was my favorite new character."
"__STAR_WARS__ I love the idea of a stormtrooper switching sides.  And I can't wait to see what the backstory is with some of these characters."
