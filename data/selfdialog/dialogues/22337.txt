"__DISNEY__ Hey, do you know which one was the first ever Walt Disney movie ?"
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely ! I think it was Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I think it was produced in 1930's"
"__DISNEY__ Oh really ! It's so amazing that I still like this movie whenever I see it."
"__DISNEY__ Same here. Though it was a classic Black & White movie, but I never miss colors watching this movie."
"__DISNEY__ Who's character you liked the most in this movie ?"
"__DISNEY__ Without question, the main character. The 'Snow White' !"
"__DISNEY__ And I would presume, you hated her step mother's character ? The wicked Queen."
"__DISNEY__ Well, same here. I am forgetting her name in the movie. Grimhilde was she ? Oh yes, her name was Grimhilde ."
"__DISNEY__ Yup. She was called Grimhilde. Do you know that the story of the movie was compiled years before the movie was released."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I know. It was done in 1934. In those days, making a movie used to take years, due to technical limitations !"
