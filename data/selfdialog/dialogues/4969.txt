"__FAST_FURIOUS__ A lot of people tend to like the Fast & Furious series for the overall story."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Right. Are you getting to something."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was going to ask you if you like any of the subplots of the movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, now that you mention it."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, go on."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was kind of into the whole thing with Letty being brainwashed."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was in number 6, right."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That's right. I liked the process of her going from being brainwashed to being back with her team."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I imagine that would be satisfying to watch."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Wait, so you haven't seen it?"
