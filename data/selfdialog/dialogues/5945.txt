"__STAR_WARS__ Have you ever seen the original Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, my favorite is Empire Strikes Back!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I love that one!  Okay, so who's your favorite character?  Mine was Luke when I was younger but now is Han."
"__STAR_WARS__ My favorite is actually Obi Wan Kenobi!  I think he is so intense.  I wish he had lived longer."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh me too! I hated when he died.  You know, the new movies are just not as good as those old ones."
"__STAR_WARS__ I totally agree.  I think that that one with Jar Jar Binks was really weird."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I do too. It was hard for me to see young Anakin and Luke and Leia's mom getting together."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know what you mean.  They just didn't match.  It seemed like she was a better fit for Obi Wan."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought so too!  They would have made a great couple!"
"__STAR_WARS__ The movie could have went in a whole new direction. Who knows, It may have even been better!"
