"__MUSIC__ Is it any good?"

"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Katy Perry single?"
"__MUSIC__ There are a number of sappy good ones, but I would have to go with 'Firework' as my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ Are there other musicians that sound like her?"
"__MUSIC__ At the risk of sounding old, I think that a lot of artists sound the same today. But you can't talk about Katy Perry without mentioning her supposed rival, Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Doesn't she sing country music?"
"__MUSIC__ She started in country, but her music always had a poppy feel to it. A couple of years ago she went ahead and crossed over to pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Has she been successful?"
"__MUSIC__ Very much so! She seems to be taking the mantle of pop princess."
"__MUSIC__ Why are they rivals?"

"__MUSIC__ It seems like every single she releases is a hit, but her single 'Shake it Off' was pretty big."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I heard a cover of that song by the band Screaming Females for the Onion's AV Club!"
