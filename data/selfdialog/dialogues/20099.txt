"__MOVIES__ Have you ever watched to movie Passengers?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea I have, with Chris Pratt, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, and Jennifer Lawrence. Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was decent."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it was amazing?"
"__MOVIES__ What did you like so much about it?"
"__MOVIES__ I just really liked the premise. I keep wondering what I would do in that situation."
"__MOVIES__ Yea it's a tough spot to be in."
"__MOVIES__ See, that's why I like it. I like impossible scenarios. Chris Pratt's character does what he finds to be the only option, but that option ruins Jennifer Lawrence's life."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was a bit unbelievable that she ended up forgiving him."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't. It's the same reason Chris Pratt made the decision in the first place. He had no choice."
"__MOVIES__ Yea but people can harbor resentment for a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Well, he did do a lot to redeem himself, and I just feel like over time, when the reality as set in, people would be able to understand and adapt."
"__MOVIES__ Yea I guess so, I mean what other choice did she have right?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Die alone in a ship where there was another person right next to you the whole time?"
"__MOVIES__ Yea, I don't know. The situation still felt uncomfortable."
"__MOVIES__ Yea but that was the whole point. It's a thinking movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yea you're right, I guess it was pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ The acting was amazing too."
"__MOVIES__ Yea, they both really impressed me."
