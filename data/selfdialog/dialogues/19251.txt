"__MOVIES__ Huh, looks like Sofia Coppola has another movie out."
"__MOVIES__ Is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ ...I have no idea! Haven't seen it, just saw an ad for it is all."
"__MOVIES__ I'm interested in watching that then."
"__MOVIES__ Same. Lost in translation is one of my favorite movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man! Bill Murray was great in that."
"__MOVIES__ So was Scarlett Johanson."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Topher Grace in that too?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so, he was the lame boyfriend."
"__MOVIES__ Right. The soundtrack was so good too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was great. When did that come out?"
"__MOVIES__ 2003, I think."
"__MOVIES__ What? It was that long ago?"
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't feel that long, right? But yeah, 2003."
"__MOVIES__ That's crazy."
"__MOVIES__ I know. Well, what's that new movie called?"
"__MOVIES__ It's called The Beguiled. Looks like it has Colin Farrell and Nicole Kidman."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sold. Wanna see it later?"
"__MOVIES__ Absolutely. How about the 7PM?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's do it."
