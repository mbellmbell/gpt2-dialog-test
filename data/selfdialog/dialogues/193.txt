"__MUSIC__ No matter what I do... I just do not like Neil Young."
"__MUSIC__ WHAT!?"
"__MUSIC__ I know, that's how people respond every single time that I say that. I just can't come around."
"__MUSIC__ You listened to After the Gold Rush?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep."
"__MUSIC__ What about Harvest?"
"__MUSIC__ Mhm."
"__MUSIC__ What is wrong with you?"
"__MUSIC__ His stuff is just not for me."
"__MUSIC__ But what exactly don't you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Uh, like everything."
"__MUSIC__ Nope, it can't be everything."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, fine. For starters... his voice sounds like a crying cat."
"__MUSIC__ I'll give that to you. At first I couldn't enjoy his voice."
"__MUSIC__ Are you saying it's an 'acquired taste?'"
"__MUSIC__ You're being sarcastic. But it totally is. For me at least, it took me hearing how great his songs were, and how authentic he is as an artist. Then I was listening for the melodies. Then I found myself all of a sudden liking his voice."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like it's just you trying to get it because other people say he's good."
"__MUSIC__ No! He doesn't have a classically 'good' voice, but he's a great singer anyway."
"__MUSIC__ I just all respect for you."
"__MUSIC__ Play his song 'After the Gold Rush' a few times. You'll love him the next time I see you."
