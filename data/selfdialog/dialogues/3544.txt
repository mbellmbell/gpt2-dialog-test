"__MUSIC__ What ever happened to Lorde?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know but I saw her on a TV interview a couple weeks ago."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  What show?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't remember for sure, but I think it was maybe Good Morning America"
"__MUSIC__ Good Morning America?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so, I don't usually have time to have the TV on but Sunday we usually do and that's the only time I can think of."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what was the interview about?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't really pay attention.  A comeback song probably."
"__MUSIC__ Did you get the name of it?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I only remember that I didn't recognize her at first and she was talking about being nervous on stage."
"__MUSIC__ I would never have thought she was the nervous type."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she said she gets really nervous during live performances."
"__MUSIC__ Why didn't you recognize her?"
"__MUSIC__ She wasn't wearing any makeup.  She looked like a totally different person."
"__MUSIC__ How?"
"__MUSIC__ She reminded me of the Seinfeld episode where Jerry had a date with a woman who would either look gorgeous or look terrible depending on the light."
"__MUSIC__ HA!  That's funny."
"__MUSIC__ She really was pretty for the most part but a little homely at times."
"__MUSIC__ She usually has some off the wall, crazy thing to say from what I've seen."
"__MUSIC__ She did mention in the interview that she sees colors when she sings.  I thought that was weird."
