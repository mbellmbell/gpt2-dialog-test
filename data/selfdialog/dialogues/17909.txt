"__MOVIES__ My sister and I never agreed on movies. She liked Disney, I like Depp, except in Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Did she drag you to those pirate movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. That's how I know I didn't like Depp in them."
"__MOVIES__ I bet she liked Lord of the Rings, too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Everything magical, anything elfin."
"__MOVIES__ So Harry Potter, stuff like that."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen all the Potter movies. That's sisterly love--of course it's better than wrestling."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think there are wrestling movies."
"__MOVIES__ At least not yet. God forbid, but you know, we both liked Edward Scissorhands."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I liked that one too. A good old movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Depp's really acting in that, not posing."
"__MOVIES__ And Winona Ryder was excellent too. We saw her change from frowsy slug to Edward's idea of her."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. That's a truly magical movie."
"__MOVIES__ It made me cry."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, me too. At the end there--movies almost never make me cry."
"__MOVIES__ You don't want to be manipulated, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I don't know. A film's supposed to move you. Thing is, it made my sister cry too."
"__MOVIES__ You cried together. A good thing."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. It's a sweet memory of her."
"__MOVIES__ So sorry, still."
