"__STAR_WARS__ Can you pick a Star Wars character out by home planet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think a few, test me?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Okay, who is home to the planet Dagobah?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That is an easy one, Yoda!"
"__STAR_WARS__ You are right. I suppose that was easy, I just love that character so much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yoda is awesome. Though I think he got a little cheesy in some aspects like the fights scenes in episode 2 or 3, can't recall which one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I do know what you are referencing,I agree somewhat. I think that wholE movie was not up to par with the others though, not Yoda's fault."
"__STAR_WARS__ You make a good point about those films at large.Can't blame one character, although jar jar comes close."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, he was annoying. But the actor playing anakin was so stiff. I did not care for his performance."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was hayden christensen, I thought he was okay. I agree slightly stiff performance."
