"__MOVIES__ So I just watched a Nightmare on Elm Street movie-"
"__MOVIES__ Love that franchise."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it's pretty great but the one I saw was Craven's New Nightmare one that came out in the 90's-?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, I LOVED that one!"
"__MOVIES__ It was genuinely good. Really meta, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like a precursor to Scream."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah both of those films were so self-aware but still super scary, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ The 'skin you like a cat' part of the Nightmare movie scarred me as a kid. Scream didn't really scar me though."
"__MOVIES__ No, yeah. Just gave me a crush on Matthew Lillard."
"__MOVIES__ YES! Did you know Matthew Lillard ad-libbed that 'I'm feeling woozy' line towards the end?"
"__MOVIES__ No way! That's hilarious. How'd you find that out?"
"__MOVIES__ The commentary on the DVD. You should watch it if you like Scream."
"__MOVIES__ I'll totally do that."
"__MOVIES__ So if you had a crush on Matthew Lillard, did you end up watching Wing Commander?"
"__MOVIES__ Such an underrated movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know! And I know it was kind of like Starship Troopers but-"
"__MOVIES__ Starship Troopers was way better but it was still really entertaining."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. Starship Troopers was better but I've heard it kind of missed the author's point with its adaptation."
"__MOVIES__ What, like it didn't mock their society enough because everyone ACTUALLY felt triumphant at the end when they killed the bugs?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, exactly. But I don't know. I still loved it."
