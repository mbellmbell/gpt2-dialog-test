"__COMEDY__ Hey, glad I caught you! I heard there are going to be some Marx Brothers movies on tonight. They're hilarious!"
"__COMEDY__ I really don't like the Marx Brothers."
"__COMEDY__ What do you mean  you don't like the Marx Brothers? Everybody likes the Marx Brothers!"
"__COMEDY__ I guess I'm the exception that proves the rule!"
"__COMEDY__ What don't you like about them?"
"__COMEDY__ I just don't really care for all that slapstick comedy. Not my thing."
"__COMEDY__ But they're so funny when they do stuff like that!"
"__COMEDY__ I know lots of people like physical comedy, but I don't."
"__COMEDY__ Well, I love that kind of stuff, pies in the face and all that."
"__COMEDY__ Then I'm sure you're going to enjoy the movies tonight. Have fun!"
