"__DISNEY__ Did you see they are making a new Pete's Dragon?"
"__DISNEY__ I believe it is out already."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder how Pete looks in this new one."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely not the goofy green dragon like the original."
"__DISNEY__ I loved the songs from that movie."
"__DISNEY__ Me too, it was such a nice story."
"__DISNEY__ Oh and how Pete cooked those apples with his fire, I used to laugh at that part all the time."
"__DISNEY__ I remember that."
"__DISNEY__ I should look online to see if I can buy a copy of the original."
"__DISNEY__ You should look to get the new one too."
