"__DISNEY__ Do you know if there are any more Tinkerbell movies coming out?"
"__DISNEY__ Not sure. I haven't heard of any new ones coming out."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah the last one was called Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast."
"__DISNEY__ That one was pretty good."
"__DISNEY__ I liked it a lot. my favorite though was the Pirate Fairy one."
"__DISNEY__ I loved how they showed a young captain hook in that one."
"__DISNEY__ It was cool. I almost thought he was a good guy until it surprises you."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it was a cool twist that he was bad all along."
"__DISNEY__ I really do hope they make a new one. I love those movies."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. I always watch them when they come out."
