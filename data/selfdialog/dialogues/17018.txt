"__MOVIES__ Do you ever watch old movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Not usually, but last week I watched two Gene Kelly Movies."
"__MOVIES__ Which ones?  Anchors Aweigh?  Brigadoon?"
"__MOVIES__ No.  I watched An American In Paris and Singin' In The Rain."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen either of them.  What did you think of them?"
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed them both.  Gene Kelly was an incredible dancer!"
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that the rainstorm scene was amazing."
"__MOVIES__ It was!  What makes it even more incredible was that Gene had a 103 degree fever that day, but he insisted on filming the scene anyway!  It was flawless!"
"__MOVIES__ Wow!  That takes major dedication!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  Actually, all three of the lead actors were excellent dancers."
"__MOVIES__ Is there anything you didn't like about either movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The only thing I didn't like is that, in each movie, there was an extended dance scene that seemed to go on forever.  The one in An American In Paris went on for twenty minutes!"
"__MOVIES__ Were both of the movies comedies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, although An American In Paris was more of a romance."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't Donald O'Conner also in Singin' In The Rain?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  He's also a dedicated dancer.  He did a very demanding song called Make 'em Laugh.  After filming, he was covered in bruises and had to rest for four days."
"__MOVIES__ That song must have featured a lot of physical comedy."
"__MOVIES__ It did.  What's worse, while he was recovering, the film was water damaged.  He ended up having to film the entire routine again!"
"__MOVIES__ Dancing sounds like a tough way to make a living."
"__MOVIES__ I agree!  I wouldn't mind being an actor, though!"
