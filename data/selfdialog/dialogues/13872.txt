"__BASKETBALL__ Hey, do you like basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, definitely. I played in high school and I like watching it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh cool, I played in high school as well, but only junior varsity."
"__BASKETBALL__ That's cool. I played through high school on both junior varsity and varsity."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh wow, you must have been pretty good."
"__BASKETBALL__ I was alright, but nothing special. Do you follow professional or college basketball at all?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I mainly follow college basketball, but I pay attention to the NBA on and off."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm kind of the opposite. I am a die hard NBA fan and sort of follow college basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh okay, yeah, it's just hard for me to get super interested in the NBA. The season is fairly long and my team isn't very good."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I can see that. I'm a fan of the San Antonio Spurs, so it's been easy to get excited about the NBA in recent years."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well yeah, the Spurs have been at least a decent NBA team for the past 20 years. They've won like 4-5 championships in that time or something like that."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, they're great. They have a great coach and have been really good about managing personnel."
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm a fan of the Charlotte Hornets, who aren't very good and haven't been for a while, so it's hard for me to get excited about it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that's understandable"
"__BASKETBALL__ My college team is the North Carolina Tar Heels, who have had much more success in college than the Hornets have had in the NBA."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah, that's one of the more famous basketball schools. Didn't Michael Jordan go to school there?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yep, and we won the national championship this year, which was awesome."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh yeah, I remember that. That must've been exciting."
"__BASKETBALL__ It was awesome and I got super pumped when they won."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I can imagine. Unfortunately, I don't think the Spurs will even be getting to the championship series this year, but maybe next year."
