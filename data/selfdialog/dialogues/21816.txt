"__DISNEY__ Oh my God wasn't Moana the greatest!"
"__DISNEY__ It was cool. Why all the excitement though?"
"__DISNEY__ Why all the excitement are you kidding me? Did you not watch the same movie I did? I thoroughly loved it! Maui cracked me me up. I was laughing so hard."
"__DISNEY__ He was alright. I think Grandma Tala was cool."
"__DISNEY__ She was cool too but Maui was my favorite. I liked the message that it sent too. That no matter what do not be afraid to do the impossible. Do not be afraid to pursue your dreams."
"__DISNEY__ You have a point there. I got that too. I liked when the wave knocked Moana over though and she wanted to quit and her Grandmother encouraged her not to quit. Kind of like life. No one promises that it won't get rough when you decide to follow your dreams but the idea is not to quit. Keep on pursuing your dreams no matter how difficult it gets."
"__DISNEY__ Ahem, now look who is getting all philosophical over Moana. (Smiles) You are absolutely right. Do you know I felt so exhilarated after watching it. It really was nice and a gentle reminder."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know that Dwayne Johnson played you beloved Maui."
"__DISNEY__ Yes I do and when I found out I love Maui even more."
"__DISNEY__ You're a nut job you know that, but I am glad you enjoyed the movie. The truth is, I enjoyed it too, I just wanted to give you a hard time."
