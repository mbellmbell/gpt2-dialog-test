"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the Slumber Party Massacre Series?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. Did they used to be on VHS?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. They're old school 80's horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ Slasher sub genre, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup! One of the best!"
"__MOVIES__ And part 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Part is one of the silliest movies you will ever see."
"__MOVIES__ What's silly about it?"
"__MOVIES__ The Driller Killer comes back from the dead in dreams!"
"__MOVIES__ Like Freddy Krueger from A Nightmare On Elm Street?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! He's taunting Courtney from part 1 in her dreams!"
"__MOVIES__ That sounds different from what I thought the movie was going to be."
"__MOVIES__ The Driller Killer has a whole song and dance number."
"__MOVIES__ I thought this was a horror movie?!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it's a horror comedy. So was Slumber Party Massacre part 1 I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Less funny from what I can recall."
"__MOVIES__ The movies are super indie and low budget, but very charming and fun."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't there a part 3?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. Part 3 is there was well. It's not as good, but still  quite fun!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm excited. I'm going to order them."
