"__DISNEY__ I just found out that I can watch Disney movies on Netflix."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Do they have any new ones or just the older releases?"
"__DISNEY__ I saw some that have recently been in theaters."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, that's very helpful. I don't always get to see movies in the theater that I want to see."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. I get busy too."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and now I can see the movies that I want to see when I have time and without leaving my house."
"__DISNEY__ Would you like to come over on Friday and watch some of the newer releases?"
"__DISNEY__ That would be great! Can I bring anything?"
"__DISNEY__ No. I will have appetizers and drinks."
"__DISNEY__ Ok. I'll bring some popcorn."
