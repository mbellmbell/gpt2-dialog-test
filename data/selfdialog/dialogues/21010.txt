"__THRILLER__ Are there any scary movies you are excited to see?"
"__THRILLER__ I'm waiting for that reboot of IT"
"__THRILLER__ Oh, the scary clown movie? Are they making a new one"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and apparently it is more closer to the original thriller novel than the movie was"
"__THRILLER__ Wow, I wonder if it will be as scary as the original"
"__THRILLER__ Honestly, I dont find the original to be very scary. It was way too cheesy"
"__THRILLER__ Are you kidding me? Tim Curry's make up had me scared to sleep for weeks!"
"__THRILLER__ Honestly, it was all too outdated for my taste"
"__THRILLER__ I wonder how good the new one will be"
"__THRILLER__ I've seen the trailer, and it was already getting me freaked out!"
