"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My boss use to have Season Tickets to the Bucs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, that's cool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, especially when he use to give us the tickets to go to Pre-season games and games he could not attend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way! Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we use to go all the time. Box Seats too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's wild. What was it like?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it was kinda underwhelmining."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, for 'Box Seats' i thought they would be more lavish. it was just regular seating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? I had no clue!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me either. I thought it would have been like a Rays game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How was the Rays seating?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, thicker, more comfortable seats for starters."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the Baseball seats were better than the Football seats."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but we still had fun and the balcont seats just covered us if it rained."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, that's not so bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, it was pretty cool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to go to a game this year, i keep putting it off."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Same here and we are so close, we should make a plan to do so this year!"
