"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Frozen? It's my favorite Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ Of course I've seen it. But I didn't think that it was as good as some older Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ I know some people think that the story was too simple, but I disagree. It was great to finally see a movie that focuses on a relationship between sisters, and not just romantic relationships."
"__DISNEY__ That's true. I did like that aspect of the movie a lot."
"__DISNEY__ It also sent a powerful message about accepting who we are. It's the only way to fully be free of the things holding you back."
"__DISNEY__ The song 'Let It Go' was perfect to convey that message. It was also one of the best Disney songs ever, in my opinion."
"__DISNEY__ Yes I agree. I think a lot of the movie's popularity was thanks to that song."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah it really made the movie very recognizable even for people who don't watch Disney movies much."
"__DISNEY__ Now every little girl wants an Anna and Elsa cake for their birthday."
"__DISNEY__ True. But they are great role models for kids so that's good."
