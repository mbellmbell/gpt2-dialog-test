"__MUSIC__ I don't understand the music the younger generation is listening to."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's all rap and it's terrible. The lyrics are almost always about drugs or sex."
"__MUSIC__ I guess so, but isn't that what every older generation says."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but to have kids rapping along to a song about 'Molly' and 'percoset'....."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a problem, and people wonder why we have a drug problem now."
"__MUSIC__ Plus, they all rap like they have a mouthful of cotton."
"__MUSIC__ Lol maybe they do...they are rapping about drugs after all."
"__MUSIC__ On a different note, I do like some of the newer artists with the different sounding voices like Daya."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, me too, that Chainsmokers song is awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard Noah Cyrus' song?"
"__MUSIC__ I have, I don't think I'm really that impressed, maybe it's just knowing she's related to Miley."
"__MUSIC__ I do miss some of the good classic rock stuff though. Nothing compares to Zeppelin and Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ Talk about singing about drugs and sex lol"
"__MUSIC__ I guess you are right. But at least they could sing!"
"__MUSIC__ True."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of singing, why the heck is Beyonce still around. She literally shrieks like a cat in heat."
"__MUSIC__ Lol, I totally agree, but I think most people like her because of her looks more than her voice."
"__MUSIC__ I guess, she is a dang good dancer, but I am not a fan of her music at all."
"__MUSIC__ I like a couple of her songs."
