"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new album from the Weeknd?"
"__MUSIC__ No but I have heard of couple of his singles on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ You should listen to it, it's really well done."
"__MUSIC__ It seems like he is very talented."
"__MUSIC__ He really is and I think he is underrated."
"__MUSIC__ It doesn't help that the radio burns you out on songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah for sure, I heard I Can't Feel My Face probably 1000 times when it came out."
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I really didn't like that song either."
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was probably the worst song on that album."
"__MUSIC__ Makes you wonder why they chose it for a single."
"__MUSIC__ Probably because it was catchy and poppy."
"__MUSIC__ I guess. It did get stuck in your head!"
"__MUSIC__ His new album is more musical."
"__MUSIC__ That one new song reminds me of Michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! The song I Feel It Coming?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That one. I really like his voice there."
"__MUSIC__ That's how most of the new album sounds."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'm a huge fan of Michael so maybe I'll give it a try."
"__MUSIC__ You really should, I think you'd like it!"
"__MUSIC__ Well if you don't mind, I'd like to borrow it."
