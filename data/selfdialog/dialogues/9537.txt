"__BASEBALL__ Who is your favorite team?"
"__BASEBALL__ I really love the Reds."
"__BASEBALL__ Me too! It is just a shame that they never make it far in the playoffs."
"__BASEBALL__ True. After trading away some key players in the past couple years, I wonder if they will recover."
"__BASEBALL__ Not sure, but the Houston Astros look red hot recently."
"__BASEBALL__ Jose Altuve has an unbelievable batting average."
"__BASEBALL__ He is also a solid infielder!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes. Did you see the Astros beat the Yankees on Derek Jeter celebration night?"
"__BASEBALL__ No. But that is sad. Derek Jeter is a terrific player."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah a real class act. The Yankees have gone downhill since his retirement in 2014."
"__BASEBALL__ That's okay with me. I was getting tired of watching them win all the time."
"__BASEBALL__ You know who I've been really impressed by? The Cleveland Indians."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASEBALL__ They made a huge run in the post-season last year. And their roster is not nearly as deep as some of the other teams."
"__BASEBALL__ True. I heard they really play as a team. Cleveland must really be excited that their team was a contender for a world series title."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe they will make a run for it again this year. Especially if Francisco Lindor stays hot."
"__BASEBALL__ Lindor is from Puerto Rico. I saw the Astros play the Marlins in an international game in Puerto Rico last night."
"__BASEBALL__ That's awesome! I did not know they did that."
"__BASEBALL__ I guess it was some sort of special occasion. But cool to learn about Puerto Rican baseball history."
"__BASEBALL__ I bet there is a rich history there. Yadier Molina for the Cardinals is also from Puerto Rico. Lots of great players are. Probably because of the nice weather!"
