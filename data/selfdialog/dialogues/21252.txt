"__THRILLER__ So, did you watch any thrillers aside from Taking Lives?  That one's old."
"__THRILLER__ Now that I remember, I recently say The Circle."
"__THRILLER__ I didn't see that one, how did you like it?"
"__THRILLER__ I loved it actually!  It was definitely classified as a thriller, but I was laughing and so were some of the other people."
"__THRILLER__ Hmm, now that's interesting.  Tell me more!"
"__THRILLER__ Basically only one truly tragic thing happened in the whole movie, which was the death of the girl's ex-boyfriend."
"__THRILLER__ So it wasn't really a scary thriller."
"__THRILLER__ Not really.  Tom Hanks was able to project that 'tech entrepreneur' thing very well."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, I could see that a bit from the trailer.  Did he remind you of anyone in particular?"
"__THRILLER__ I guess Steve Jobs.  He was always talking about taking things to the next level and acting like a visionary."
