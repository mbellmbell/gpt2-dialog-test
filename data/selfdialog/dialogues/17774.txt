"__MOVIES__ My boyfriend wants to take me out to the movies. What's showing in cinemas right now?"
"__MOVIES__ To be honest with you, I have no idea. I haven't been in ages!"
"__MOVIES__ Me either! I tend to just watch TV at home, but he really wants to go! Help!"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, let's look up something. What type of movies does he like?"
"__MOVIES__ Hmmm well I know he loves sci-fi type of movies, but I hate them"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure you can find something else. Does he like adventure movies? Most guys do"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! Actually, you're right - he does"
"__MOVIES__ The new Fast and the Furious is out now."
"__MOVIES__ I've already seen it!"
"__MOVIES__ I thought you said you don't go to the movies..."
"__MOVIES__ Yes yes, I know I said that but I took my two nephews to see it last week."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok. Well then that's out... The new Pirates of the Caribbean debuts this weekend."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really? That would be perfect! I know he's seen the first two"
"__MOVIES__ I've seen them. I love Johnny Depp because he's so good looking!"
"__MOVIES__ He's not really my type, but he is definitely a great actor."
"__MOVIES__ Oh he's amazing. Have you ever seen Sweeney Todd?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was really good in that. I think he was nominated for an Oscar for that actually."
"__MOVIES__ Yes but I can't remember if he won or lost. He should have won!"
"__MOVIES__ I think he lost."
"__MOVIES__ Oh well, maybe he will get nominated again for this Pirates of the Caribbean, and win this time!"
