"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Bjork record?"
"__MUSIC__ I haven't yet! Is it good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's really interesting, but it is Bjork."
"__MUSIC__ I saw her newest music video and it's pretty crazy."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think of the song?"
"__MUSIC__ To be honest, I felt like the artistic aspect video was the main selling point. I really didn't like the song."
"__MUSIC__ What about it didn't you like?"
"__MUSIC__ It was very hard to listen to. The music didn't really work with itself."
"__MUSIC__ Ah yes, I can see that, though that is pretty typical of Bjork's music."
"__MUSIC__ True. What else have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I've actually been getting back into Symphonic metal for some reason."
"__MUSIC__ Oh no way! I used to listen to a lot of symphonic metal: Nightwish, Epica, Within Temptation..."
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to so much Within Temptation lately!"
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! The Dutch seem to have some pretty good symphonic metal bands. What have you been listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I've been feeling a bit nostalgic lately, and I've been listening to The Heart of Everything."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, that came out, what, around 2007?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! My favorite song off that record is Our Solemn Hour. How about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love that one, but I think The Howling might be my favorite."
"__MUSIC__ All of the songs really are so good, and the record puts me in such a good mood."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. Sharon den Adel's voice is beautiful."
