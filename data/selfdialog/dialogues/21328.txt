"__THRILLER__ What is your favorite Horror movie franchise or one that's always stoodout to you?"
"__THRILLER__ The Nightmare on Elm Street movies were always great to me, how about you?"
"__THRILLER__ To be honest, that was going to be my response as well! What was your favorite movie from the series?"
"__THRILLER__ I don't think you are going to top the original. That was great stuff."
"__THRILLER__ Agreed. I feel the first and third were by far, the best."
"__THRILLER__ Those were before Freddy Krueger became a bit more silly and he was still a very scary force."
"__THRILLER__ I always felt the third movie was a good blend of dark humor and horror."
"__THRILLER__ Definitely. That was where the one-liners were first introduced, but not necessarily being over-done at that point."
"__THRILLER__ Agreed. At the end of the day, Freddy Krueger is one of the greatest horror icons ever."
"__THRILLER__ For sure. Robert Englund is the only man who can play that character, in my opinion."
