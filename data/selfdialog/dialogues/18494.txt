"__MOVIES__ You now what kind of movie I want to make?"
"__MOVIES__ What?"
"__MOVIES__ Historical epic with most detailed research."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's not an easy are. Historical research is actually pretty tough."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have a team of well educated and anal historians working on it."
"__MOVIES__ For that you need money."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have scores of bored Wall st investment bankers funding it"
"__MOVIES__ For that you need a detailed plan and a business model"
"__MOVIES__ For that I'll have a business manager work on it."
"__MOVIES__ Just a business manager? What is a business manager? Do you have have a business degree to be a buiness manager? Does the position come with a dental? Retirement account?"
"__MOVIES__ A business manager is someone who has a keen business acumen and be able to address the business needs of my vision."
"__MOVIES__ So... you need money to hire this business manager."
"__MOVIES__ Do I?"
"__MOVIES__ I woudln't work for free if I was this 'business manager.' But you need the business manager to talk to the Wall st Bankers for funding. How are... you know what. Nevermind. So historical epic, eh? What time period?"
"__MOVIES__ When was Ghengis Kahn? That time."
"__MOVIES__ 'Genghis Khan' was born in the 12th century."
"__MOVIES__ That's my time. And the place is Europe."
"__MOVIES__ Holy Roman Empire's defense against the Mogol horde. It wasn't really that bad. Hardly wroth the time to make a movie about it."
"__MOVIES__ How come? How do you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for starters, Mongols only got to bhe boundaries of the Holy Roman Empires, but by then Ogedai had died. So the prince leading the invasion Batu, Genghis's grandson had to return home. And The pope at the time called for a crusade against the mongols, but it didn't go over very well. So a movie about Mongols in Europe isn't going to work."
