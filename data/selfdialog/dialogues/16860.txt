"__MOVIES__ I'm a big James Dean fan."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Didn't he only do a couple of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ He completed three, though his last two, 'Rebel Without a Cause' and 'Giant' came out after he died."
"__MOVIES__ What was the other one he did?"
"__MOVIES__ 'East of Eden,' which was the adaptation of John Steinbeck's novel."
"__MOVIES__ So the iconic image of him in the red jacket and jeans, which is that from?"
"__MOVIES__ That's from 'Rebel Without a Cause.' It came out in 1955 and was kind of like 'The Breakfast Club' of that time."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean? In what way?"
"__MOVIES__ It was focused on the plight of teenagers and how misunderstood they are by adults, but from a teen's point of view."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I see. Who else was in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo were the other main stars, though Dennis Hopper and Jim Backus were in it as supporting players."
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't James Dean's character kill someone in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, though he's involved in a car race, or a 'chicken race' and the other guy's door sticks. He ends up going over the cliff and dying."
"__MOVIES__ Dang, that's a tough way to go."
"__MOVIES__ The other guy's friends tried to put the blame on Dean's character, but really no one but bad luck could be blamed."
"__MOVIES__ Did he get arrested?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he had befriended a detective or something who was more interested in getting the whole story rather than assuming the worst."
"__MOVIES__ So someone finally took a chance on him."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah his parents either ignored him or patronized him so it was good to finally have an adult guide him."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a more complex movie than I thought."
