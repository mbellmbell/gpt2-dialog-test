"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see The Nice Guys?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think so, when did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ Last year, oh man, it was a really great movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Now I'm excited! What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about two guys that become private detectives and try to find out who killed an adult film actress."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it's a thriller?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, no, not really, it's more of a mystery comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds like a fun time, maybe I'll check it out."
"__MOVIES__ You should, especially if you like Shane Black movies, he directed it."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know much about directors. What else did he do?"
"__MOVIES__ Iron Man 3 was the big one, and he also worked with Robert Downey Jr. in Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Iron Man 3! Now I really want to see this. Does it have Robert Downey Jr. in it too?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but it does have Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling."
"__MOVIES__ Weird, I just watched another Ryan Gosling movie last night! He's also a good actor, I will definitely give this a shot."
"__MOVIES__ Good to know, it's not for everyone, but if you like zany comedy it's really funny. It also has some action and the mystery holds together well."
"__MOVIES__ I've been looking for some good stuff to watch, thanks for the suggestion. Is it on Netflix?"
"__MOVIES__ No problem. I don't think it is on Netflix, actually. But I have a copy on Blu ray if you want to borrow it."
"__MOVIES__ That would be great! Hey, why don't you come over and we can watch it together."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome! I would love to rewatch it, I'll grab it and head over now."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good, see you soon!"
