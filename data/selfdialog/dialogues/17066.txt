"__MOVIES__ Did you know Tarantino will stop making movies after 10?"
"__MOVIES__ 10 what? 10 movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes."
"__MOVIES__ How do you know?"
"__MOVIES__ It was on reddit a while ago."
"__MOVIES__ You can't believe everything you read on reddit."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but this is legit, he said it himself. He will quit after making 10 movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's so stupid, why would he do that?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it has to do with how he sees himself as an artist."
"__MOVIES__ So the hateful eight was his 8th film? That's kinda convenient."
"__MOVIES__ Seeing as how it sucked."
"__MOVIES__ The hateful eight was the worst of his movies. If he's an artist quitting after 10 movies, he's not doing that well."
"__MOVIES__ But I think the package of a director that quits at the height of his success is what he's going for."
"__MOVIES__ Well, again, his last movie sucked, so he's not really at the height of his career."
"__MOVIES__ That's a fair point, but it did make a lot of money."
"__MOVIES__ How much?"
"__MOVIES__ 155 million."
"__MOVIES__ That's not much at all Kill Bill raked in 333 million."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and he considered Kill Bill 1 and 2 as one single film. So he can still make more movies after 10 if he makes prequels, sequel, etc"
"__MOVIES__ That's one weird dude, you know that?"
