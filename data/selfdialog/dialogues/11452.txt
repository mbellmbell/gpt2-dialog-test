"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Cowboys can win the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's more likely they'l win in a couple years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why is that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I think the odds of Dak doing as good as his rookie season are low."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah you see QBs have sophomore slumps a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Zeke will be just as good this year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think Elliot could have the most rushing yards in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know about that, don't forget about Bell."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Bell will probably have more all-purpose yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but if Cowboys really rely on the run then who knows."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Jason WItten, is he getting too old?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he obviously isn't the same player he used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he is still an effective run and pass blocker."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but he certainly can't catch well anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You also got to worry about the Cowboys' defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they did a good job of drafting a lot of young talent though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but those guys are going to need time to develop."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I'm saying that they need a couple more years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah hopefully they win one soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to win one while they have the extra cap room from having a low paid QB."
