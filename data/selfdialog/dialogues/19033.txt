"__MOVIES__ Hey! Did you get around to seeing La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it actually!"
"__MOVIES__ You heard about the Oscars fiasco, I assume?"
"__MOVIES__ I did! I feel sorry for the filmmakers, but I think Moonlight deserved it."
"__MOVIES__ I think so, too. But I did really like La La Land."
"__MOVIES__ Someone told me they thought it was a little silly. What do you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I did have some trouble with the tone changes. Parts are very happy, and parts are very depressing."
"__MOVIES__ So it didn't flow well?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think so at all. It's simultaneously partly realistic and partly in another universe."
"__MOVIES__ How did Ryan Gosling do?"
"__MOVIES__ Charming as always. Hey girl, he really could play the piano!"
"__MOVIES__ Wait, he actually learned to play the piano?"
"__MOVIES__ He did! The film never shows someone else's hands. He actually learned to play. In three months!"
"__MOVIES__ That's incredible! I couldn't master anything in three months."
"__MOVIES__ I'm no expert, but I thought he played very well!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard some controversy about Ryan Gosling's character co-opting jazz for white people."
"__MOVIES__ There's definitely that angle. White people aren't going to save jazz."
"__MOVIES__ But John Legend was in it, too?"
"__MOVIES__ He was! I really loved their band. Okay, now it's time for you to see it! I want your opinion!"
"__MOVIES__ Would you want to see it again? Let's find a copy!"
