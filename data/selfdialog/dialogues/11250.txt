"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is going to win the NFC this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking it's going to be the  Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a great offensive line, Elliot is a beast and Dak will mature another year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You forgot to mention their defense, they've made some improvements on that side too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Cowboys all the way in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I happen to think the Falcons are going to win the NFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How come?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Even though they lost the Super Bowl last year, they will be hungry to get back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I disagree with you, they lost Kyle Shanahan. It's going to hurt their offense more than you think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they didn't lose any other players and they still have Matt Ryan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree Matty Ice is a great quarterback."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ryan is the best quarterback in the NFC behind Brees and Rodgers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as Ryan doesn't get hurt, the Falcons will win at least 10 games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You also forgot that they have Julio Jones!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Julio is the best receiver in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In addition, they have the best 1-2 combo at running back with Freeman and Coleman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I overlooked them.  If you can run the ball it opens up everything on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking Falcons and Cowboys in the NFC title game this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wait, what about Green Bay!"
