"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So who do you think is the best in the game right now?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ In my opinion, Kendrick Lamar easily."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? Which album do you think would be his masterpiece?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ While Good Kid M.A.A.D City and 'Damn.' were great in their own lanes, I think To Pimp a Butterfly will stand the test of time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True though, to be fair, I think it's a bit lazy to outright say Kendrick is the best."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Who else is possibly better?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well there's J. Cole, Kanye West, Vic Mensa...the list goes on."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah but I don't think they can touch the pedigree of Kendrick."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well then why hasn't Kendrick dissed Drake yet?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wow, that's a good point."
