"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you an NFL fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I break out my jersey and fire up the grill every Sunday!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The New Orlean Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a lot of really good players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If Drew Brees can stay healthy they are Super Bowl contenders."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is getting pretty old. Think he can maintain such a higj success rate?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has a lot of good receivers backing him up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Michael Thomas had a pretty good season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So did Mike Ingram and with Adrian Peterson joining the team we will be strong at the Running Back position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why did they take AP when they already have Ingram?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ingram may or may not remain consistent. Either way you don't pass on a legend like AP."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have thought he would have retired a Viking but I guess he wants to see more playing time and I am not sure he would have received that with the Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the two strong Running Backs on the Saints Brees will not have to throw as much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The dual running and receiving threats will give defenses something to struggle with."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thag should create more opportunities for Brees to complete passes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still don't think he will maintain 4-5 touchdowns a game like he typically does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not if they are running the ball more."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they can keep Drew healthy and get past the Falcons they may have a shot this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They will destroy the dirty birds this season."
