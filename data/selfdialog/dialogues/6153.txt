"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think will happen in episode eight?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know the Kylo Ren is coming back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Is general Leia going to be in it since Carrie Fisher died?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  I think I remember reading how she finished all her parts before she died."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think we'll find more information about her family?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  Maybe she is Luke's daughter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke seemed really depressed in the new trailer for episode eight."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know.  It's weird that he wants the Jedi to end."
"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder if Luke is going to be moving around a lot."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  He definitely is showing his age."
