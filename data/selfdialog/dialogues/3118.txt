"__MUSIC__ So have you heard heard Miley Cyrus's new single yet?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean Wrecking Ball?"
"__MUSIC__ Dude, you gotta get with the time, Wrecking Ball was a couple years ago."
"__MUSIC__ Wait, seriously? Whoa, I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. Her most recent song is called Malibu."
"__MUSIC__ Is this one as raunchy as her last one?"
"__MUSIC__ No, actually, she's gone back to a bit more of the country style."
"__MUSIC__ That's certainly a style shift."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she's had a lot of those in her career."
"__MUSIC__ True. Hannah Montana years were very different from what she became."
"__MUSIC__ My kid was obsessed with her when she was younger, it's a shame she went nuts."
"__MUSIC__ Well, maybe she's coming back. What's Malibu like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, like I said it's much more country-pop. Like a slightly more sultry Taylor Swift."
"__MUSIC__ Miley's got a great voice for that; it's nice and rich."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she could have really rivaled Tswift if she'd stayed in that zone, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Are the rest of her songs going to be in that vein, or?"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like it. In an interview she said she's 'no longer' the person in her old music."
"__MUSIC__ Not surprised. She did a full one eighty when she came out with her last album, and now she's balancing that."
"__MUSIC__ Well, if the rest of her songs are like Malibu, I think she's finally figured something out."
"__MUSIC__ Nice, I'll have to check it out!"
