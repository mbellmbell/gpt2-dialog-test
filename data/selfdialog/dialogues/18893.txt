"__MOVIES__ I got a tough question for you.  Which is your favorite James Bond movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Wow, that is a tough question.  There's more than twenty of them!"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, I will narrow this down a bit then.  Who is your favorite James Bond actor?"
"__MOVIES__ You will think this is odd.  Roger Moore."
"__MOVIES__ Oh really?  Most people say Connery."
"__MOVIES__ Connery was terrific no doubt.  But I really liked Moore.  His James Bond movies were the ones I watched when I was young."
"__MOVIES__ Well that is fair.  James Bond has been around so long I think a lot of people identify with the ones they watched growing up."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly.  I know a lot of younger people choose Brosnan or Craig."
"__MOVIES__ So is it fair to say a Roger Moore Bond movie is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so.  I'd pick For Your Eyes Only."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, that was a good one."
"__MOVIES__ Yea.  It was kind of smaller scale, they kept the cheesy humor and ridiculous action to a minimum."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I really liked that.  It was just a tight well done Bond movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  So what about you.  Who is your favorite Bond and which is your favorite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Ok, honestly I like the newer Bond movies the most.  The Daniel Craig series."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing wrong with that.  So which one is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ The first Craig Bond movie.  Casino Royale."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, of course!  Terrific movie."
"__MOVIES__ Would you say it could be the best Bond movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I wouldn't go that far.  It's one of the best, but I can't say any single Bond movie is the absolute best."
