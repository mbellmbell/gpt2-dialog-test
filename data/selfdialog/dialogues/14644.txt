"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, friend!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hey, good to see you! How has your week been?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's been OK. I've been kind of sick."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ah, sorry to hear that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's OK. I called in to work and just played video games and watched movies all day."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah? What movies?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, I'm feeling a little too crappy to really focus on anything, so I watched some of my old favorites."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I turned on Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. I hadn't watched that one in years."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's definitely one of my all-time favs as well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's amazing how well it holds up. What's it been, 30 years now?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ At least that, I'd bet."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I also watched Mad Max: Fury Road. Have you seen that one?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah. It's so good."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Maybe my favorite movie that came out last year."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Seems like weird sick day viewing though, don't you think?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I don't know; I kind of just turned it on and let it wash over me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ OK, I can see that. It's a crazy movie but very visually pleasing."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Definitely. Some of my favorite action sequences ever."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That first vehicle chase sequence belongs in a museum."
