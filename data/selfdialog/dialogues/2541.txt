"__MUSIC__ Hey, I hear Dave Mathews will be coming to town this year."
"__MUSIC__ Really, I haven't seen them in years."
"__MUSIC__ You're a fan?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the biggest. That band reminds me of my college days so much."
"__MUSIC__ Me, too. How many concerts have you been to?"
"__MUSIC__ Me and my wife have seen them at least ten times."
"__MUSIC__ Awesome. I've been to a few concerts of theirs as well."
"__MUSIC__ There's just so much energy at their concerts."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I love when they just go off script and jam and then manage to bring it all back together."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously! I love when Bella Fleck plays with them."
"__MUSIC__ He's awesome, but Carter Bueford is probably the best drummer I have ever seen."
"__MUSIC__ You think so?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, without a doubt. Have you even seen him play? He uses both feet."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! I never even noticed."
"__MUSIC__ I love the jazz undertones, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's like a blue grass, jazzy, rock band."
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes, I wonder why they still aren't mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ They'd be selling out."
"__MUSIC__ I guess your right. You going to get tickets when they come around?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely!"
