"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Looking at the upcoming schedule for the NFL, what games interesting games stand out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots and Raiders in Mexico City."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good one. Those two teams in Mexico City with the high elevation and pollution thick enough to chew. Interesting to say the least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys have a string of games heading into Christmas that are insane."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They go to Giants stadium for a rivalry, they play in Oakland, then they have the Seahawks coming into Cowboys stadium."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow. That is a rough patch. Giants have had their number and should be even better, then a rejuvenated Raiders in Oakland, then licking their wounds back home against a team like Seattle. Man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That sandwich game in the middle with the Raiders is interesting. Cowboys will be coming in after their rivalry and Raiders will be off of a rivalry in Arrowhead vs. Kansas City."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who does Oakland play after the Cowboys?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They go to Philly. Never know which Eagles team will show up year to year. I know they don't like Christmas though lol."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So the Raiders have to face their rival, the Cowboys, and then go into Philly on Christmas Eve where they boo Santa Claus and throw snowballs at him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. Should be a real interesting stretch late in the season with teams that are already fighting hard heading into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is some insane scheduling."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the AFC West and NFC East playing each other this year makes it extra brutal for those teams in particular."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots @ Broncos. Patriots struggle in Denver in the thin air. This is the week before they go to Mexico City in the Raider game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they'll have the back to back road games vs. tough teams in high elevation environments. The scheduling seems extra harsh this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of good games though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great games, actually, but rapid fire. I shouldn't be this excited about football this early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I've barely flipped through the schedule myself and this just seems like a really intense season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can't wait."
