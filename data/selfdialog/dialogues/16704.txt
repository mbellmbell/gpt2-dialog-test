"__MOVIES__ I watched the movie This is the End for the first time last night. I really enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ That movie is so funny. I love that there are so many stars in it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! There's so many famous faces: Seth Rogan, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride and so many others!"
"__MOVIES__ I was doing some reading on the film, there are actually a lot of real-life references in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well for example, the jokes they make about each other in the film, a lot of them are based on truth."
"__MOVIES__ How so? Give me an example."
"__MOVIES__ You know how Jay Baruchel dislikes Hollywood and doesn't want to hang out at James Franco's house in the movie? That's actually true."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding. I wouldn't have guessed that. Although it makes sense since they all play themselves in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's lots of things like that in the film. I read that a lot of feelings got hurt during the making of the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting. That makes me want to watch the movie again to catch the inside jokes."
"__MOVIES__ I did the same thing after I read about that."
"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite scene in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ There's so many of them. But I like all the scenes where Danny McBride is being such a jerk."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah the scene when James Franco wakes up and Danny is eating all the food they have left to survive."
"__MOVIES__ That was funny. Also the scene where he pours their last jug of water over his head."
"__MOVIES__ And when he puts on the tuxedo James Franco wore when he hosted the Oscars!"
"__MOVIES__ I also like the part when they're trying to Exorcise Jonah Hill, the things he says while he's tied to the bed."
"__MOVIES__ And then he just goes up in flames."
"__MOVIES__ Hilarious film. Definitely worth watching multiple times."
