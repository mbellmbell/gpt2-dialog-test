"__MUSIC__ I just picked up the greatest hits of CCR, it was just rereleased again."
"__MUSIC__ Who is CCR?"
"__MUSIC__ They were a rock group back in the 60s."
"__MUSIC__ What does CCR stand for?"
"__MUSIC__ Credence Clearwater Revival"
"__MUSIC__ Does that have any meaning?"
"__MUSIC__ You know, I'm not sure, I've never heard what it meant."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music do they play?"
"__MUSIC__ Rock, maybe a hint of folk or blues thrown in."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds interesting, do they sound like any other groups out there?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they definitely had their own sound. Within seconds of one of their songs starting, you just knew it was them, especially when the lead singer started singing."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that about the lead singer?"
"__MUSIC__ He had a very unique, kind of raspy voice that wasn't mistaken for anyone else."
"__MUSIC__ Did they have any hits?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they had quite a few hits and some of them became iconic songs from the 60s, they really hit a chord with people."
"__MUSIC__ What happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know there real reasons behind it, but apparently they had a bitter breakup, at least a couple of them were family members and didn't talk to each other for a long time."
"__MUSIC__ That's a shame when that happens. Were any of them successful after the group?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, the lead singer John Fogerty took a number of years off to help raise his children and when they got older, he went back in the studio and recorded a number of hits and I believe the later 80s and into the 90s and had successful concert tours that packed the house."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds really interesting and I will have to look up both CCR and John Fogerty as I'm always looking for some unique music."
