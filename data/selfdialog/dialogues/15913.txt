"__ROCK__ I'm more indifferent than anything."
"__ROCK__ Yeah can't say I'm a huge fan, but Summer of 69 is such a nostalgic sort of tune."
"__ROCK__ I can agree with that, makes up for the overly sappy Everything I do, I do it for you."
"__ROCK__ Ha yeah that song is incredibly sappy indeed."
"__ROCK__ Yeah at least Straight From The Heart has a minor edge to it."
"__ROCK__ Emphasis on minor edge, but agreed."
"__ROCK__ To be fair even though as I stated I'm largely indifferent, I do here he's good live."
"__ROCK__ I've heard the same actually, I would go to a show if the cost was right."
"__ROCK__ Same here, then again I simply enjoy live music."
