"__MOVIES__ What are your top 5 favorite movies?"
"__MOVIES__ The entire Rocky series, because that can count as one for me, Roger Dodger, Almost Famous, Big Lebowski, and Zodiac."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, Zodiac huh?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's a great movie-- I could watch it on repeat.  The cast is excellent, and there is a lot of attention to detail."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr working years before Avengers."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the director's cut of Almost Famous?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it's almost 3 hours, but it doesn't feel that long."
"__MOVIES__ A lot of the additional content is very subtle, but I think it adds a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that there's a yearly festival celebrating the Big Lebowski?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah-- Lebowskifest.  I'd love to go-- I could quote that movie endlessly."
"__MOVIES__ Are you a big Coen Brothers fan?"
"__MOVIES__ I like all of their movies, but I only really love a few of them, like Lebowski, and Raising Arizona."
"__MOVIES__ Nicholas Cage in his best role, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like his turn in the Wicker Man?"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, nah.  I didn't really like the original Wicker Man either.  I thought it was too slow and dull."
"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite remake?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like Rob Zombie's Halloween.  I honestly thought the originals were kinda drab, especially in comparison."
"__MOVIES__ How about that remake of Psycho?  It was basically a shot for shot recreation."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was a movie that probably didn't need to be made."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed."
