"__DISNEY__ I think the Fox and the Hound is a great movie."
"__DISNEY__ I agree with you. I like the old Disney cartoons way better than the newer ones."
"__DISNEY__ The movie is so sad, but so nice at the same time."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the way Copper and Todd are torn apart by Copper's owner is so sad. I cried!"
"__DISNEY__ I liked the song that the birds sang with the owl in that movie."
"__DISNEY__ 'Lack of Education!' Haha."
"__DISNEY__ Do you know when that movie was made?"
"__DISNEY__ I'm not really sure. Probably back in the 1990s or something."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah you're probably right."
"__DISNEY__ I think Flubber came out around the same time."
