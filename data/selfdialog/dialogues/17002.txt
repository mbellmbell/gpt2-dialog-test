"__MOVIES__ That was a great movie, wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but it's decent popcorn fare."
"__MOVIES__ What? You didn't like The Shallows?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't say I didn't like it. It just wasn't a 'great' film."
"__MOVIES__ So it is  no Jaws, but The Shallows is still a viciously, violently fun wave to ride."
"__MOVIES__ The Shallows is too sappy to be lean and mean."
"__MOVIES__ Really? It's like that."
"__MOVIES__ The Shallows is almost a good movie."
"__MOVIES__ I found it be very suspenseful...tense. Made me jump a few times."
"__MOVIES__ It was kind of cool but honestly I found it boring."
"__MOVIES__ It started out good, though,like a realistic movie."
"__MOVIES__ But then unrealistic things happen. Like the shark jumping with fire, or the ending."
"__MOVIES__ It was a decent movie."
"__MOVIES__ Only if you didn't think too hard. Once you do start to think about it that's when you ask, 'what am I  looking at?'"
"__MOVIES__ True it could have been more realistic."
"__MOVIES__ It was very unrealistic from start to finish in my opinion. I wish I could get my money back."
"__MOVIES__ As an unsatisfied customer?"
"__MOVIES__ Very unsatisfied."
"__MOVIES__ I kept yelling through the movie, get out of the water."
"__MOVIES__ That's is why I am glad I did not sit next to you."
