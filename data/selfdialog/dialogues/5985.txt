"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite lightsaber duel?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Definitely Anakin vs. Obi-Wan"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's the most beautiful and most intense, with lots of flippy crap."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ha, flippy crap, nice. I don't like that one."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why not?"
"__STAR_WARS__ It's too rehearsed: fighting doesn't work that way."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I know, battles should end in like 10 seconds. But this is science fantasy."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked Anakin and Dooku. Showed his progress and was short-and-sweet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Obi-Wan surviving a PLATFORM falling on him was a bit ridiculous."
