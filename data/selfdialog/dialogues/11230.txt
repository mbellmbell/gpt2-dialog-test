"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who do you think the best running backs are going to be next year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have my eye on the new kid, Ezekiel Elliott"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ oh definitely. he had a crazy season last year. 1,631 yards and 15 TDs. that is like beyond all star quality"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm also going to be watching Jordan Howard"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He looks really good as well. He only found the end zone 6 times, but he did rush for 1,300+ yards. he is going to do good things for the bears if he stays with them"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course I will also have my eye on Le'Veon Bell"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know what it is about him, but I really don't like his running style"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He puts up huge numbers. he ranked in the top 5 last year, and only played three quarters of the season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ he does put up big numbers, but the way he stutter steps and hits the hole so delayed is annoying. I think defenses will eventually figure him out"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ no way. he is a rock star. so long as he stays healthy he will have a great year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ personally, i'm going to watching how DeMarco Murray continues to perform"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Tennessee's quarterback, Mariota. If he continues to perform, that will only make Murray more dangerous"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's already extremely dangerous. he averaged 80 yards a game last year with about 4.4 yards per carry"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ no doubt. do you think LeGarrette Blount will repeat his performance again. surpisingly that old workhorse lead the league in TDs for RBs at 18!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ holy cow. i didn't know he had that many. he really adjusted to New England well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i personally think he might be a little too old to put up those kinds of numbers again"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ David Johnson will probably have another stellar year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had him in one of my fantasy leagues. he just racked up points for me week after week"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ you are so luck. he had 16 TDs last year. that got you a ton of points"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I could count on him almost every week."
