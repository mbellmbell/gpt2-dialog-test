"__MOVIES__ Are you excited to see the new Descpicable Me movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I am! I have to say the second was my least favorite, the first is the best in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, the first was the best. Steve Carell makes a great Gru."
"__MOVIES__ He does. I like Miranda Cosgrove as Margo."
"__MOVIES__ Next to Gru, Agnes is my favorite character. She's adorable!"
"__MOVIES__ She is. It's cute how she loves unicorns."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the part when Gru blew up the carnival game to win her the unicorn."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! He had no choice, the carnival barker was being unfair. She hit the spaceship!"
"__MOVIES__ The roller coaster part made me queasy, but the graphics were pretty cool."
"__MOVIES__ I love the minions. They are so funny."
"__MOVIES__ They are! Have you seen the movie Minions?"
"__MOVIES__ Believe it or not, I haven't. I love Despicable Me, but have yet to see Minions."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you should definitely check it out, it's awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Who does the voices for that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Pierre Coffin is the voice of the minions, Sandra Bullock is in it, Jon Hamm and Michael Keaton."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I like Michael Keaton, he's awesome."
"__MOVIES__ He was great in Beetlejuice."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, he was the best. That's such a classic."
"__MOVIES__ I even enjoyed Alec Baldwin in that film, even though I'm not usually a Baldwin fan."
"__MOVIES__ I like Geena Davis. She's a great actress."
