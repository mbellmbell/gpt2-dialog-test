"__BASEBALL__ Are you coming over tonight to go to the game?"
"__BASEBALL__ I don't know if I want to go."
"__BASEBALL__ Really?  It's the last one on the season!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, but they really haven't been doing well anyway."
"__BASEBALL__ I know what you mean, but it's the last game!"
"__BASEBALL__ I'll think about it, but we're on the bad side of a losing streak and I really could care less."
"__BASEBALL__ Tonight might be different, we actually didn't bat bad last game."
"__BASEBALL__ I don't think one game of decent batting will make up for for eight games of horrible losses."
"__BASEBALL__ Not really, but we might see some good batting tonight and that might lead to a good game."
"__BASEBALL__ Who has the upper hand on pitching?"
"__BASEBALL__ Our pitching staff is actually better by far, which is another reason you should come with me."
"__BASEBALL__ So they actually stand a chance to win?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, man!  Batting is up and their pitching is definately no match for ours."
"__BASEBALL__ What is the ERA of their starting pitcher?"
"__BASEBALL__ Like seven point something.  He is horrible."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, our guys will run all over him!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, and we have 3 guys who actually have a couple game hitting streak despite the losses."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I guess it's not their fault we keep losing."
"__BASEBALL__ So you gonna come out?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, sounds  like it will be a great game!"
