"__STAR_WARS__ You know the Star Wars series is about good versus evil don't you?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Get out! I thought it was a coming of age movie for Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ A movie can have more than one theme. In the first Star Wars movie Luke Skywalker learns that Darth Vader is his father."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, James Earl Jones did Darth Vader's voice justice. It seems like that role was written for him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does Stars Wars movies seem like the Indiana Jones movies that takes place in the sky galaxy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah except Harrison Ford played a whole lot older Indiana Jones than he did play a young Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like how George Lucas uses android robots in his Star Wars series."
"__STAR_WARS__ R2d2 reminds of Cousin It in the old school series Adams Family. (laughs)"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think Carrie Fisher  made a great Princess Leah didn't you? I wished they would have changed her hair though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lucas had to have a woman who could handle he own in the galaxy. I'm going to Carris Fisher in the future Star Wars movies."
