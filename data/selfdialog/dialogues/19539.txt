"__MOVIES__ Personal Shopper was such a good movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Kristen Stewart?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's the movie. It's a smaller indie movie I think but it got raving reviews from critics at the film festivals."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a horror movie? I can't tell from the photos I've seen or the from the title."
"__MOVIES__ Personal Shopper definitely doesn't sound like a horror movie, but it is a horror movie. More like a Ghost story."
"__MOVIES__ That's interesting. Why is it called Personal Shopper?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Kristen Stewart's character in the movie plays a personal shopper for this other actress, I forgot her name, but she's this famous model in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ This sounds odd, but tell me more."
"__MOVIES__ Kristen Stewart is basically this other character's stylist, which means she shops and basically picks out the clothes for this woman to wear to make her look good."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I get it now, but where is the horror or supernatural element in all of this?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I haven't told you, but Kristen Stewart is a medium. She can basically see and feel the presence of ghost. So her character's motive and personal objective is to find closure from her late brother who passed away."
"__MOVIES__ So she's trying to communicate with the dead, is that what you're trying to tell me?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah she's trying to find out if there truly is an afterlife and that her brother is okay there. It's probably one of Kristen Stewart's best performances to date."
"__MOVIES__ If we throw out the Twilight series, I think Kristen Stewart is a very underrated actress in terms of talent. Twilight seems to have given her a bad reputation as a bad actress."
"__MOVIES__ I think it has to do with that and how she carries herself. She's always just very depressing and serious and one note in interviews. It gives that impression."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed her in Camp X-Ray, that was such a moving picture. She was fantastic in American Ultra too!"
"__MOVIES__ I think she has good range, and if people put their biases aside, they'll see she's actually a really fine actress. I don't know if you've watched Clouds of Sils Maria but she was also really good in there!"
"__MOVIES__ I did see that, her and Juliette Binoche had such good chemistry!"
"__MOVIES__ Check out Personal Shopper, it's a horror, crime, mystery, all locked in with Kristen Stewart giving a pretty powerful performance. It's very suspenseful and tense and it's actually from the same director as Clouds of Sils Maria."
"__MOVIES__ Olivier Assayas! That's the director. I love his style. It's very cinematic and slowly paced so you get a chance to absorb the scenes and what's happening around the movie. I didn't know he directed Personal Shopper, I'll have to give it a watch."
