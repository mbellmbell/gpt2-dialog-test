"__ICEHOCKEY__ Who is your favorite hockey player of all time?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ It has to be The Great One - Gretzky."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Boooring! I was always a fan of Messier."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I suppose he was good. Those New York teams gave people something to be proud of when their basketball franchise struggled."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What country do you think produces the best hockey players?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I am of course partial to Canada, but there have been people from all over."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think we will ever see more diversity in the professional leagues?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hard to say. Hockey is just not a sport that is played all over the world because of its tie to winter."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I suppose that's similar with a lot of winter sports."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, I guess if there was a Jamaican bobsled team, we could see more hockey programs sprouting up."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What do you think is more exciting, hockey or soccer?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I like both for what they are, but hockey is definitely fast paced and exciting."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think the fights help with that?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Maybe a little, there is something about watching a fight that keeps some fans coming back."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I remember when I saw a minor league hockey game live, there were 5 or 6 fights."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That's funny."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think they did it just to entertain the crowd."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And were you entertained?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, years later I don't remember the score at all, but I remember that."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I guess that's your answer."
