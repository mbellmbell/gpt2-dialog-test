"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite thing about The Empire Strikes Back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ There are a lot of wonderful elements to Empire, but my favorite would have to be Yoda."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a great character."
"__STAR_WARS__ My love comes from Frank Oz, who acted and voiced Yoda"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, are you a Muppet fan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ From way back. I was thrilled to see a Muppet alumnus enter the Star Wars mythos with a great character."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was an interesting choice to do Yoda live with a puppeteer."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it was brilliant. It gave Mark Hamill a real actor to play off of, and it made Yoda more real to me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Real for a puppet, you mean."
"__STAR_WARS__ The Muppets have been real to me forever! I loved that the greatest Jedi Master ever is a little green puppet thing."
