"__MUSIC__ You know who I haven't listened to in a long time?"
"__MUSIC__ Your mother? No, really...who?"
"__MUSIC__ Ha. No, the Indigo Girls. I used to love their songs!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I listened to them a ton in the 90s!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I had a tape of their self-titled album which I probably played a thousand times."
"__MUSIC__ Is that the one with Blood and Fire on it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! I loved that song, so raw and powerful."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely, and both women have killer voices."
"__MUSIC__ Right? I think my favorite part about them though is how different their voices are."
"__MUSIC__ True. They wrote good songs for both singers too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, though I think everyone liked one singer or the other better."
"__MUSIC__ Not me. I liked them both!"
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I think my favorite thing about them is the harmonies."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah when they sang together it was awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I used to sit and try and sing along with one and then the other."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I think I learned how to sing harmony from listening to that band."
"__MUSIC__ They didn't always pick the easy harmony either. I heard Galileo come on the radio the other day and when I listened to the harmonies they were really cool."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that song. 'How long till my soul gets it right...' Great song."
"__MUSIC__ It is, and like I said, they don't pick the harmonies that are the most obvious all the time."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, but once you've listened to them do it those are the harmonies you hear."
