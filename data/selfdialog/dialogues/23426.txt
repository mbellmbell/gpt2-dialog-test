"__DISNEY__ Do you like Disney movies?"
"__DISNEY__ I love them."
"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite one?"
"__DISNEY__ I like Cinderella the best.  How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite one is tangled."
"__DISNEY__ Oh that is a good movie.  I love her magical hair!"
"__DISNEY__ Her hair is amazing!  Too bad her mother is so mean."
"__DISNEY__ Well it's not really her mother.  Can you imagine being locked up in a tower like that?"
