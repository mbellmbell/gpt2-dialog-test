"__HARRY_POTTER__ Wow, I just finished the Goblet of Fire movie, and some of the visuals were just insane."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What part do you mean? The fight at the Ministry?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, that is the big one of course. The Dumbledore and Voldemort fight."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The sheer power was amazing, it actually felt real for the first time."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Agreed, a lot of the show of power before that was just kinda cheesy in the other movies."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But this felt like an actual fight to the death, right? The lightning crackling sealed it for me, it was so cool."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Then after the fight you see the sand moving."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That part was too much, I had trouble breathing."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yep, the sand moving slowly and you know something bad is going to happen."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Then Harry gasps and Voldemort tries to take possession of him. Most intense part in any of the movies to that date at least."
