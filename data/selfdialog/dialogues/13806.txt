"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know what direction the Dallas Mavericks organization is going?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't either. I mean Nowitzki is still there maybe they're waiting for his era to be over."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but I don't think you can afford to do that"
"__BASKETBALL__ You're right! Especially in the Western Conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ You cannot afford to be mediocre. Either you suck or you add pieces to get better through free agency"
"__BASKETBALL__ When you look at their roster. Where's their future?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Exactly. I mean Harrison Barnes is a good player, but not great"
"__BASKETBALL__ And Wesley Matthews is a good defender, but a horrible shooter"
"__BASKETBALL__ This roster has holes every where"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I mean they did pick up Nerlens Noel, but has he already maximized his talent?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I thought he would be a little bit better than he is but maybe he needs more time."
"__BASKETBALL__ You could be right, but when I see him play I just don't see it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Keep in mind he did deal with some injuries. I think he deserves a little more time"
"__BASKETBALL__ Perhaps, but they need way more than what he can offer"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah he is a decent piece but they need star power"
"__BASKETBALL__ Who wants to come to this team the way that it is presently constructed."
"__BASKETBALL__ That in lies the problem doesn't it."
"__BASKETBALL__ It really does. I men they have some okay complimentary pieces but it's just not enough."
"__BASKETBALL__ They need more scores and three point shooters on this team"
"__BASKETBALL__ My thoughts exactly. They got a lot of work to do, but I do love their owner, Mark Cuban."
