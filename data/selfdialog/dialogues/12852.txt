"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Training camps are starting for NFL football soon.  I'm already getting excited!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me, too.  I can't wait to keep watching the Browns lose this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're still a Browns fan?  That's nice of you."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I  know.  I think they made some good draft picks this year.  Finally."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't you say that every year?  Who did they get, again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Myles Garrett and Jabrill Peppers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are good picks.  If they use them correctly.  Which they never seem to do."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is true. Hopefully they'll make good decisions when it comes to quarterbacks this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will start this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good question.  They have four choices.  I read they're going to give them all an opportunity to show off and then go from there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They drafted a quarterback this year didn't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes.  DeShone Kizer in the second round."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not bad.  Who else do they have to chose from?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cody Kessler, Brock Ossweiler, and Kevin Hogan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns are always lousy with quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. That's why I think Myles Garrett was a great use of their first draft pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about RG III?  Is he still there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is.  I think they just need to make better use of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like every year is a rebuilding year for the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe so.  But hey, if we win two games this year, it will be an improvement!"
