"__ROCK__ So is U2 going to have a new album soon or what?"
"__ROCK__ Not sure.  I keep hearing they will be but nothing ever happens."
"__ROCK__ The last album was pretty critically-panned."
"__ROCK__ For good reason.  They threw something out there without really making a good record."
"__ROCK__ Kind of reminds me what they did with Pop.  That was garbage."
"__ROCK__ Oh yeah.  Remember Discotheque?"
"__ROCK__ Don't remind me.  What were they thinking?"
"__ROCK__ I guess they were trying too hard to be different."
"__ROCK__ Just stick with the classics.  Everyone loves Joshua Tree."
"__ROCK__ That's an album I still listen to."
