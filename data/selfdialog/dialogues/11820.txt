"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, what teams do want to see in the next Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ideally for me, it would be a Bears versus Packers Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do love the rivalry there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ However, I do not see that happening."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I don't either."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who would you like to see in the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would really like to see the Titans, or the Falcons again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Titans made some good pick ups in the draft. It's possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think they'll be strong, but not Super Bowl material."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. There are other teams that look much stronger."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just don't want to see the Patriots again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't either. Unfortunately they're the top ranked team still in the power rankings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not that they don't deserve it. I'm just tired of seeing them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have to agree with you there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's still highly possible that we see the Packers or the Cowboys go to the next Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be a nice change of pace."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are both looking very strong this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always thought Aaron Rodgers was a huge talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's one of the best for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He just had a bit of misfortune last season that held the team back."
