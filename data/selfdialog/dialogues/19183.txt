"__MOVIES__ I'm thinking about buying my sister a movie for her birthday."
"__MOVIES__ That's thoughtful! What kind of movies does she like?"
"__MOVIES__ I think her favorite movie of all time is Legally Blond."
"__MOVIES__ That was the one with Reese Witherspoon and Luke Wilson?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that's the one. They made a sequel or two."
"__MOVIES__ If she liked that movie a lot, you probably want to get her a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what I'm thinking."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe something starring Reese Witherspoon?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure what other comedies she's been in. She was really good in Walk the Line."
"__MOVIES__ The Johnny Cash biopic? I never saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, you should totally see it. Joquain Phoenix is great in it!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you think your sister would like that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Eh, it's a little gritty for her tastes, I think. Johnny Cash wasn't always a nice guy."
"__MOVIES__ OK, so something lighter, then. What about Election?"
"__MOVIES__ What's what?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a movie starring Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick. A dark comedy."
"__MOVIES__ It doesn't ring a bell."
"__MOVIES__ Witherspoon is this over-achiever high school student and Broderick is a teacher. It's pretty funny."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll get that one for her, then. Thanks for the recommendation!"
"__MOVIES__ No problem, hope she likes it!"
