"__MOVIES__ What is your most favorite movie you went to see in a movie theater?"
"__MOVIES__ That is a hard choice."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have a few in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ Well two actually. ET and Raiders of the Lost Arc."
"__MOVIES__ I love those movies but why are they your favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ ET was the first movie my mother took me to after my parents got divorced."
"__MOVIES__ I would think that would be a sad reason."
"__MOVIES__ It was but it was also a bonding element for my mother and I so it was a good thing."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that and it makes pretty good sense."
"__MOVIES__ It is nice when you can attach a good memory to a bad situation."
"__MOVIES__ And why do you like Raiders of the Lost Arc."
"__MOVIES__ My mom and I went to see it after I got home from the first summer trip to my dad's after the divorce."
"__MOVIES__ So it has sentimental reasoning too?"
"__MOVIES__ No not that one, it was just hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean hilarious? There were a couple of funny parts but I wouldn't describe it as hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ So my mom and I were having issues because I was pissed she wouldn't let me come home early when I was miserable."
"__MOVIES__ How old were you then?"
"__MOVIES__ I think I was 13 or maybe 14."
"__MOVIES__ Ok so why was it so funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Remember when Harrison Ford fell down into the chamber with the snakes and the cobra stood up in front of his face? My mother who is petrified of snakes, cleared the chair and had her butt and feet both on the back part of the chair where she stayed while watching the rest of the movie."
