"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your favorite NFL team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mine? Oh, I don't know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you not know? You watch football every Sunday, Monday, Thursday, and Saturday!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Saturday is college football.  That doesn't count."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever. Why do you watch every Sunday if you have no favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have favorites.  But not just one...I have many!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How does that work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Perfectly!  In every game, I chose a favorite, and then as I cheer, every game has meaning."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what happens when your favorite teams play each other next week?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's easy.  I cheer for the one least likely to win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What?  You cheer for the likeliest looser?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's right!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That means you lose most of the time!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only if you are obsessed with scores."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ THis is football!  Of course you are obsessed with scores!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you don't care about scores, then you don't care about winning!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How can you win if you ignore the scores?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I win each and every time I support my teams.  And cheering for them helps make up for the fact that I bet against them."
