"__DISNEY__ Do you know what the first cartoon Disney movie ever was?"
"__DISNEY__ Let's see. Was it Bambi?"
"__DISNEY__ Close. It was actually Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, right. That's based on some sort of fairy tale, isn't it?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. It was a fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm."
"__DISNEY__ Can you name all of the dwarfs?"
"__DISNEY__ Let's see. Dopey, Sneezy, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Doc and Bashful."
"__DISNEY__ Nice. That movie is such a classic."
"__DISNEY__ Even people who have never seen it probably know about the seven dwarfs or the song 'Heigh-ho'."
"__DISNEY__ Yes. That one, and 'Whistle While You Work'."
