"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite genre of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I love Italian and European Westerns from the 1960s and 1970s."
"__MOVIES__ You mean like the Eastwood ones with Sergio Leone?"
"__MOVIES__ The ones that a layman would probably know are the Leone ones but there are many enjoyable ones besides that."
"__MOVIES__ What are your favorites?"
"__MOVIES__ Django, for one, the original."
"__MOVIES__ What do you like about them?"
"__MOVIES__ They're like a glimpse into this bizarre other world where English is spoken via dubbing and the picture quality is horrible."
"__MOVIES__ Why is the picture quality so bad?"
"__MOVIES__ I primarily watch them via a Mill Creek DVD set with two movies to each side of 20 DVDs. They're public domain copies so the quality is really sketchy."
"__MOVIES__ What else do you like about them?"
"__MOVIES__ They're very visceral, every man with a gun is a Grim Reaper ready to bring death upon whoever opposes him."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a really cool way to watch."
"__MOVIES__ It is. Also, the stunts are crazy. You never really know what you're going to see."
"__MOVIES__ What are some other movies you recommend?"
"__MOVIES__ There's this far-out one called Keoma starring the main guy from Django, Franco Nero, that's really out there."
"__MOVIES__ Where can I see these movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Some are available to stream on YouTube. If you look up Spaghetti Western on Amazon several sets come up."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds great!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it is, but you have to take the movies on their own terms. They won't always make sense or be any good, but I enjoy them very much!"
