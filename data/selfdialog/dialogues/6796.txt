"__STAR_WARS__ What order should I watch these movies in?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I've heard there are a few ways to do it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, there are a couple ideas. I'm traditionalist though. Old then new."
"__STAR_WARS__ Hmm. So I shouldn't start with the prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think you need to. Some people like watching the old one after one or two though. As a flashback."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why would they do that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ To keep the reveal of Vader being Anakin a surprise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh. I guess that would be a surprise if you hadn't seen the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. It's a little more fun that way."
