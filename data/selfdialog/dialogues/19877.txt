"__MOVIES__ Did you hear they're going to remake Mary Poppins?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! How do you feel about that?"
"__MOVIES__ A little bittersweet. I mean, the original was a staple in my house growing up and I don't want to see anyone mess with that."
"__MOVIES__ I feel you. But at least part of the original will make it into this one."
"__MOVIES__ How do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Dick Van Dyke is gonna be in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. He was probably my favourite thing about the original."
"__MOVIES__ He really made the movie. I'm so glad that out of all the original cast members he's gonna make an appearance."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Plus, they won't have to try to make him look old this time like they did in the last one."
"__MOVIES__ He wasn't old in the last one...?"
"__MOVIES__ Not his main character, Burt, but remember he also played one of the old guys at the bank?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I remember that! I heard that the little boy didn't know that was Dick Van Dyke until later."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I guess they didn't want him to think of him as anything other than that character."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder how else it will be like the original, if they'll make any references to it or anything."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know..."
"__MOVIES__ I want them to honor it, without riding too much on the success of it, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's gonna be tough."
"__MOVIES__ But I can't wait to see how they pull it off."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing could replace the original for me though."
"__MOVIES__ That's for sure. There will never be another tea party on the ceiling, or a day at the chalk painting races."
