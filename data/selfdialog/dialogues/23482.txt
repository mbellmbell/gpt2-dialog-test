"__DISNEY__ I saw that Emma Watson was in the new Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ She hasn't really been in many movies lately."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder if she can sing well for Belle. Belle's character does a lot of singing, doesn't she?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes. She has a pretty big musical number near the beginning if I remember correctly. I wonder who is playing Gaston."
"__DISNEY__ Luke Evans is playing Gaston."
"__DISNEY__ Who?"
"__DISNEY__ He was the guy that played Bard in The Hobbit series."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I know him. He's a good actor."
"__DISNEY__ I bet he does well as Gaston."
"__DISNEY__ I'll let you know what I think after I see the movie."
