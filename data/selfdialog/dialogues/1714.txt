"__MUSIC__ What do you think of opera music?"
"__MUSIC__ I like opera sometimes, but I haven't heard a lot of good stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Most people haven't, even I haven't."
"__MUSIC__ What did you have in mind when you asked?"
"__MUSIC__ I was wondering if you've heard any of the music from The Phantom of the Opera."
"__MUSIC__ Not really, what's it like?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, it's so good!"
"__MUSIC__ What's so good about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Each song just flows so nicely and has such a memorable melody."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds cool, I like that."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure you'd love all the music in there."
"__MUSIC__ Is it a movie?"
"__MUSIC__ There is a movie rendition of the play, but the music came from the play originally."
"__MUSIC__ Is the movie version any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I think it probably has the best recorded versions of all the songs."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, that's a pretty good compliment."
"__MUSIC__ It deserves it. The main girl's voice is so gentle and pleasing, and the Phantom's is very suiting for his character."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like it'd be fun to listen to."
"__MUSIC__ I have the soundtrack if you want to borrow it."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, let me borrow it over the weekend and I'll get back to you."
