"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really like the Pats offensive skill set."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They proved it against St. Louis, and they didn't even have Gronk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That must have killed him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, he was limited to 9 games, but he was as good as any other tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but he is usually way better.You think he'll have a good year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I see him on the circuit, no restrictions! He appears ready to go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also added the dude from New Orleans, what is his name?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brandin Cooks.He can really fly?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How fast, faster than Hogan.For sure, not even a doubt!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Randy Moss then! I would not try to compare his speed to Moss."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was different, almost all throws were upfield. Cooks is a bit shorter, too, but can also play the slot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really, they have 5 receivers, all at least very good. Malcolm Mitchell came on strong!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And Amendola keeps taking payouts in order to stay on the team. Danny is still a clutch player.With proper use, he could play two or three more years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they should've jettisoned the big back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, what I think does not matter! We trust in Bill!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LaGarette Blount was on fire last year. He scored 18 touchdowns!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But, maybe Belicek always gets it right with guys. Can you remember any coming back to bite him in the.."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, he is the greatest coach in football history, even above Bill Walsh."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Vince Lombardi.He won the first two Superbowls. He would have won more if he came later."
