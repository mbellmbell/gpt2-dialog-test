"__HORROR__ What did you think of The Babadook?"
"__HORROR__ Loved it now that I finally got a chance to watch it. Far too often nidern day horror is disappointing."
"__HORROR__ See I knew you would like it, it reminds me of a good classic horror film."
"__HORROR__ I can certainly see the comparison, it was refreshing to not rely on so many jump scares."
"__HORROR__ Yeah for me it's all about atmosphere and this film had it in spades."
"__HORROR__ Agreed it also makes me wonder what Jennifer Kent is going to direct next."
"__HORROR__ Whatever it is I eagerly anticipate it, think she's got quite the future ahead of her."
"__HORROR__ No doubt about it, Noah Wiseman also played the bratty little kid to perfection."
"__HORROR__ He did, but not sure I would necessarily say he was bratty, well okay he was, but more a product of his environment."
"__HORROR__ Yeah that kid had things pretty rough."
