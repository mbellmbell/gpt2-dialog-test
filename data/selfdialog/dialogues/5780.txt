"__STAR_WARS__ Who was the best Star Wars villain?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's easy, Darth Vader all the way."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was just awesome.  Maybe the best bad guy in movie history."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, not that many can stand up to him."
"__STAR_WARS__ He also had the most raw power potential of any character."
"__STAR_WARS__ This is true, but after his injuries he might have actually been powered down."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought that.  He was the best though."
"__STAR_WARS__ So intimidating too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, with that deep voice and the Force choke."
"__STAR_WARS__ He was just unleashed in Empire Strikes back."
