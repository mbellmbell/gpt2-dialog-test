"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you going to be rooting for this NFL season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know I love my Cowboy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But they have had a lot of problems lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I wish they didn't have so many off the field problems."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jerry Jones really needs to do something to keep his players out of trouble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, but if they had a coach that demanded respect like Jimmy Johnson or Tom Landry it would make a difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least they seem to have their quarterback situation worked out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. I really like Prescott. He had a great season last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I can't wait to see him now that he has some experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I predict this will be a break out season for him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am going to miss Romo, but it was time for him to retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He had too many injuries to be successful."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. He was never going to get Dallas to a Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. They probably should have let him go before now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. Dallas is always a contender at the beginning of the season, but never seem to manage the hype."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully this year they will be more motivated."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So are you saying you think they are heading back to the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't go that far. They still need to stay injury free and keep their players out of trouble."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything is possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. It would be good to see them holding up the Lombardi trophy at the end of the season."
