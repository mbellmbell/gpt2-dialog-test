"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen any of Jimmy Stewart's movies?"
"__MOVIES__ How can you not of seen a film with Jimmy Stewart in it?"
"__MOVIES__ True, he did play in some of the best."
"__MOVIES__ He's an icon, he's still the reason I know what a filibuster is."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Mr. Smith goes to Washington. He really does look like a Senator though"
"__MOVIES__ Well his voice makes him seem perfect for the job; I think Obama might have been a big fan of his work."
"__MOVIES__ You know until you said that, I never reallised how much Obama does talk like Jimmy Stewart."
"__MOVIES__ Well if you're gonna be president, you could pick way worse people to emulate."
"__MOVIES__ Now that I'm thinking about it, Obama kind of looks like him too; they're about the same build and same kind of shaped head."
"__MOVIES__ Well just be glad it's a Mr. Smith resemblance and not Rear Window Stewart."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but that would be way funnier to watch at press conferences, 'honey, those dang reporters are pack again.'"
"__MOVIES__ I liked him in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with John Wayne."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that one like ten times."
"__MOVIES__ Well it's pretty cool watching him stand up against a gunslinger."
"__MOVIES__ Especially when he wouldn't even pick up a gun."
"__MOVIES__ I was so confused at the end when you find out John took the shot."
"__MOVIES__ I know, but it did make more sense that he took him down."
"__MOVIES__ Jimmy Stewart is like the best good-guy from movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well he's usually a man in high moral standing,"
"__MOVIES__ Or a Dog in high moral standing like in Fievel Goes West."
