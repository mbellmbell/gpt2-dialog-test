"__MUSIC__ Who's your favorite band these days?"
"__MUSIC__ I love the Jayhawks."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they're still around? I haven's listened to them since Hollywood Town Hall."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they just came out with a new album last year and toured this year."
"__MUSIC__ What's the new album called? Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Paging Mr. Proust. It's one of their best, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. Is it more country or pop?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say more pop. Especially compared to Hollywood Town Hall and Tomorrow the Green Grass."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I like their country stuff better. What else you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, mostly old stuff in my car, like Arcade Fire."
"__MUSIC__ Oh they're a good band, I really like the Suburbs."
"__MUSIC__ That's my favorite of theirs. What are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm still addicted to Prince."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, man, it's been over a year now!"
"__MUSIC__ I know, I can't stop listening to Purple Rain."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a huge fan of Prince, to be honest."
"__MUSIC__ What?! He was a genius!"
"__MUSIC__ I get that, but I was never really into him. I like When Doves Cry and Little Red Corvette."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Sinead O'Connor's cover of Nothing Compares 2 U?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I didnt even know that was a Prince song until after he died."
