"__ACTION__ Oh, man. That new Mummy..."
"__ACTION__ There's a new Mummy too? Man, I haven't seen Brendan Fraser for a while."
"__ACTION__ No, man. He's not in it. It's... different."
"__ACTION__ He's not? So they rebooted another reboot? Like Spider-Man?"
"__ACTION__ Yeah, I don't know why they do this. This is really bad."
"__ACTION__ Is it the same story? Same characters and everything?"
"__ACTION__ No. I don't... know if it's the same as those old ones, but it's not like the Brendan Fraser ones."
"__ACTION__ What is it like, then?"
"__ACTION__ Well, it's got Tom Cruise as a soldier in modern-day Iraq. And... uh, it's got Jekyll and Hyde."
"__ACTION__ What."
