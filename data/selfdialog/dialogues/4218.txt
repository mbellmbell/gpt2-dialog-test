"__MUSIC__ Do you ever listen to Zac Brown Band?"
"__MUSIC__ A little bit! What are your favorite songs by them?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that my all-time favorite is Chicken Fried."
"__MUSIC__ Everyone loves Chicken Fried, myself included!"
"__MUSIC__ It is a great song, an oldie but a goodie."
"__MUSIC__ Do they have any new song?"
"__MUSIC__ Homegrown is the newest song I know of."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, how it? I think I may have heard it before."
"__MUSIC__ It's good. It's a typical song about a small town."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a lot of country songs! What other country artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I really miss the older singers of the 1990s. Those are my ultimate favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Who are some examples?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely George Strait, Travis Tritt, and Alabama."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love George Strait. He is one of the best country singers of all time."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! I never got to see him in concert, which makes me sad."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, does he not tour anymore?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I think technically he is 'semi-retired.'"
"__MUSIC__ Oh that is too bad. I would have liked to see him live as well."
"__MUSIC__ Alabama still tours though and they actually have some new music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard it. It isn't nearly as good as their old stuff."
