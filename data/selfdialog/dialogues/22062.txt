"__DISNEY__ Did you watch Disney movies as a child?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I used to watch 'The Wonderful World of Disney' on tv."
"__DISNEY__ So did I!  I remember it came on Sunday nights right after 'Wild Kingdom.'"
"__DISNEY__ I used to get excited when the graphic of Cinderella's castle popped up with Tinkerbell flying around.  You knew something fun was about to happen."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, me too.  What were some of your favorites?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, 'Cinderella', of course, and some of the live action movies like 'Escape to Witch Mountain.'  How about you?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved 'Cinderella' too, and I remember seeing 'Escape to Witch Mountain' at the theater.  What was the first Disney movie you saw at the theater?"
"__DISNEY__ I think maybe it was 'The Rescuers.'  It's hard to remember that far back.  Which was the first you saw?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was 'Alice in Wonderland.'  I remember going after dance practice, and we were a bit late and missed the first part.  But that was back when you could stay for the second showing, so we stayed and watched again."
"__DISNEY__ That sounds fun.  What great memories."
