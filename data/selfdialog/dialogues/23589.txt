"__DISNEY__ Are there any Disney movies that you didn't like?"
"__DISNEY__ I tried to watch Alice in Wonderland, but it was weird."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I didn't even understand the birthday scene with the Mad Hatter."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, you mean the unbirthday scene?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, see that didn't make sense to me."
"__DISNEY__ What about the dancing cards?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, that song was catchy at least, not sure what they were supposed to be doing though."
"__DISNEY__ I did kind of like the Cheshire Cat?"
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't he the one with the glowing eyes, that would disappear?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah he was, he was creepy, but I still kind of liked him."
