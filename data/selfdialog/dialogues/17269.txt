"__MOVIES__ You saw The Hunger Games, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, sure did.  Saw all the movies actually."
"__MOVIES__ So what was your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I would actually say the original."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Catching Fire myself."
"__MOVIES__ Nothing really wrong with Catching Fire, just lacked some of the gut-punch of the original."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that.  It's always more impacting when it's the first time."
"__MOVIES__ The actual hunting each other part was better and less fanatical in that movie I thought."
"__MOVIES__ Which movies did you not like?"
"__MOVIES__ All of Mockingjay.  Both Parts 1 and 2 were dreadful."
"__MOVIES__ Completely agree.  They were just not good at all."
"__MOVIES__ I hated how they tried to make her some sort of great soldier."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  That's just not her thing."
"__MOVIES__ And don't get me started on the ending."
"__MOVIES__ I was so irritated by it."
"__MOVIES__ The book ends that same way, but still."
"__MOVIES__ It was just such a letdown.  Makes you wonder what the whole point was."
"__MOVIES__ I think they were getting at that it doesn't matter who's in power, things don't change."
"__MOVIES__ I guess.  Just kind of depressing overall."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes everything can't have a Hollywood ending."
