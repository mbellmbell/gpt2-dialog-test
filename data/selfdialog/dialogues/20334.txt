"__MOVIES__ Did you hear about the director for the Han Solo spinoff movie being replaced by Ron Howard?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I heard a little something about that. I wonder if it will make the movie better?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure hope so! I do have a lot of faith in Ron Howard though."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, has has done some pretty amazing work. Do you know why they git rid of the old directors?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, apparantly they were wanting to take the movie in to much of a comidic direction for the executives at Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm, that's interesting. But shouldn't a Han Solo movie be funny?"
"__MOVIES__ Well he is a funny charactor, but I think it was more like they were wanting to make a comedy rather than a Star Wars movie with funny Han moments."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that makes sense. I just hope they do better with this spinoff than they did with Rouge One."
"__MOVIES__ You didn't like Rouge One?"
"__MOVIES__ It was OK. There were some great moments and it was very well made, I just didn't feel a connection to the story or charactors."
"__MOVIES__ That's a good point. I think this will be better since we all know and love Han already."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. This is a story of him when he was younger right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it sounds like they will kind of show how he learned to become a smuggler."
"__MOVIES__ That will be fun!"
"__MOVIES__ Totally! They also have a great actor to play Lando so I hope we get to see Han win the Milinum Falcon!"
"__MOVIES__ I would love to see that!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too! We should plan to get tickets and see it on opening night."
"__MOVIES__ I would be down for that. When does it come out."
"__MOVIES__ Good question, I'll have to check."
"__MOVIES__ Well whenever it does, let's plan to go see it!"
