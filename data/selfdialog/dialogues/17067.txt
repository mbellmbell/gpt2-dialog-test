"__MOVIES__ Do you think there will ever be an Arrested Development movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No way. There are other shows that deserve a movie before it anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Like what? Name one!"
"__MOVIES__ Off the top of my head? Um... The Venture Bros., for sure."
"__MOVIES__ That's a cartoon! I meant live action movies."
"__MOVIES__ You should've said that then. Besides, Aqua Teen Hunger Force got a movie, so I don't see why it can't."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure Aqua Teen was way cheaper to make."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but even so, a Venture Bros. movie would cost way less than something like Minions or Finding Dory."
"__MOVIES__ And less people would want to see it. That's why those movies get such a big budget."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's true. It seems like it's all about turning movies into shows these days anyway."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. Twelve Monkeys got turned into a show."
"__MOVIES__ So did The Exorcist. Every classic movie is now a TV show, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ This isn't new. They've been turning movies into TV shows for decades."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I guess they did have things like that Robocop cartoon back in the '80s."
"__MOVIES__ That is a little different, but yeah. Old shows get turned into movies all the time, too."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe originality is dead in Hollywood. Everything is just remakes and sequels now."
"__MOVIES__ I think it's been that way forever. Even since the beginning of film they've been turning books into movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's great, because then people can watch something, and they'll never have to read ever again!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh c'mon, don't tell me you didn't like Young Adult Novel 97 The Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe once we reach 100 that'll be the end of it, and Hollywood will finally shut down for good, having run out of things to adapt."
