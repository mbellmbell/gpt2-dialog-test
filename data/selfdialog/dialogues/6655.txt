"__STAR_WARS__ Have you read any of the expanded universe novels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have, I was really upset when they made all the old novels part of the expanded universe instead of cannon."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, I agree. That was very disappointing."
"__STAR_WARS__ What was your favorite series?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was a fan of the New Jedi Order series the most."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too! I also liked the Young Jedi Knights series about the solo kids when they were young."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah the fact that they were the focus of many of the books but their stories were erased from cannon was a hard pill to swallow."
"__STAR_WARS__ I could see not really caring if you never read the books but if you did read them than it was very depressing to know you will never see them in movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope they do some expanded universe films in the future, I want to see some movies with Anakin, Jacen and Jaina so bad!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe eventually they will, but they have a lot of movies planned for the future so it will probably be awhile before they do."
