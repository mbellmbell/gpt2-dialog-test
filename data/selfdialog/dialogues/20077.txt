"__MOVIES__ What did you think about 'Pitch Perfect?'"
"__MOVIES__ I think it was a fun movie with catchy songs, but with a few weaknesses."
"__MOVIES__ Which weaknesses in particular?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, what stood out was that the characters were too one-dimensional."
"__MOVIES__ Do you mean Becca, Anna Kendrick's character?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  She was too self-centered and fake edgy."
"__MOVIES__ I felt that way too, even though I really love Anna Kendrick as an actress."
"__MOVIES__ Also, the supporting characters weren't fleshed out well either.  They were all stereotypes."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, there was an Asian character stereotype, a lesbian character stereotype, among others."
"__MOVIES__ And there was no pay-off with those stereotypes.  No hidden commentary."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, they were sort of just there for cringeworthy one-liners."
"__MOVIES__ That was indeed probably the movie's greatest weakness."
"__MOVIES__ Aside from that, what did you like though?"
"__MOVIES__ The music mashups were all really well done."
"__MOVIES__ The riff-off was creative and an interesting spin on a cappella genre."
"__MOVIES__ Way more fun than Glee."
"__MOVIES__ I also love the actor Adam Devine."
"__MOVIES__ Is he the guy from 'Workaholics?'"
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  He's so funny."
"__MOVIES__ He's hysterical.  His character really made the movie for me."
