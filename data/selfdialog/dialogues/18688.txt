"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, but I have been looking for a good historical movie to watch."
"__MOVIES__ What kind of movies do you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, as far as historicaly movies go, nothing beats We Were Soldiers."
"__MOVIES__ That is a good one. Have you seen the World War II period movies like Saving Private Ryan?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have. What other suggestions do you have?"
"__MOVIES__ Well there are a couple of newer ones. Have you seen Fury with Brad Pitt?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have not. Are there any more recent historical films you can suggest?"
"__MOVIES__ How recent do you mean? There are a plethora of more modern films."
"__MOVIES__ Perhaps something that is not widely known about, like World War II."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I can reccomend Hotel Rwanda. It is about the genocide that took place over there."
"__MOVIES__ I have heard that is a good movie so I will have to try it."
"__MOVIES__ Warning though, it is very emotional and a little gruesome."
"__MOVIES__ I think I can handle it. Have you seen any good movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I haven't been able to find a movie I have really loved since Pitch Perfect 2 came out."
"__MOVIES__ Did you hear that they are making another one?"
"__MOVIES__ Really, when is that going to come out?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the movie is set to be released around Christmas this year."
"__MOVIES__ I hope it is not a flop. I am not sure where they can go with the plot from where they left off."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you will just have to wait until it comes out in December."
