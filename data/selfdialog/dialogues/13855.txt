"__BASKETBALL__ Have you been watching the Playoffs this year?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, it's kind of boring though."
"__BASKETBALL__ I thought it was just me!"
"__BASKETBALL__ It will end up being Cleveland v Golden State again I think."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too. Do you think they'll both sweep?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It's probable. Which is crazy, and unexciting to watch."
"__BASKETBALL__ Rounds 1 and 2 had some great games, though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, the Spurs/Memphis series was really great."
"__BASKETBALL__ I just can't remember the last time it was this anticlimactic."
"__BASKETBALL__ Last year was at least exciting because it was Curry v Lebron for the first time."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, this just feels like a repeat of last year."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Golden State might win it though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Maybe. LeBron is still playing like he's in his 20s though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, he's really on a mission to win it again this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ Will you watch the NBA Awards?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Just to see who wins MVP, I think."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't like that they're waiting to announce the winner."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me neither, it's better when it's just their team there."
"__BASKETBALL__ You think Westbrook will win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, and he deserves to win too."
