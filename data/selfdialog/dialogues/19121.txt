"__MOVIES__ Hey did you see Peter Jackson's new Hobbit films?"
"__MOVIES__ Of course I did."
"__MOVIES__ Okay remember the attractive dwarf who fell in love with an elf? What was his name?"
"__MOVIES__ I know it was Kili or Fili. I think Kili."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds right. That's the one that had a relationship with Evangeline Lilly right?"
"__MOVIES__ I think so. Do you mean that elf who is played by that girl from the show Lost?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes her. Ok, so his name is Kili, got it."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you want to know?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I was just thinking about the film, and trying to figure out that actually happened in the book."
"__MOVIES__ I'm almost certain it didn't. I think they even invented that character, because there are very few female characters in Tolkien's work."
"__MOVIES__ That explains a lot. Well Peter Jackson took a lot of liberties with Lord of the Rings as well."
"__MOVIES__ He did, but I think it made for some better films overall, don't you?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely, like when the Ents refused to go to war until the hobbits tricked them into seeing the devastation that Isengard had caused."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right! That was such a powerful scene!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh definitely, I will never forget the bellowing noise they made."
"__MOVIES__ The cinematics in special effects in that scene were insane!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh I know, do you remember when they broke the dam and flooded the entire plain?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! And then that ent puts his leaves in it to extinguish fire!"
"__MOVIES__ The whole thing was awesome really."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah they did an amazing job with such long books."
