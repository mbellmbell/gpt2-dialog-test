"__DISNEY__ What are your top three Disney Movies?"
"__DISNEY__ Hmm  Three?  Is that all I get?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep, just three!"
"__DISNEY__ Ok, so I'll go with... Beauty and the Beast, Moana and Lion King"
"__DISNEY__ Ooo Oldies mixed with a brand new one!  You didn't like Frozen?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it, but I liked Moana better.  And I've loved Beauty and the Beast and Lion King since I was a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, why do you like them all so much?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely the music!   Circle of life, Tale as old as Time, and You're Welcome.  How can you go wrong with those?!"
"__DISNEY__ To true, but what about 'Let it Go'??"
"__DISNEY__ That's a good one, I just love the others so much more!"
