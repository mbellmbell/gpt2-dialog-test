"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think will be the biggest letdown this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking the Atlanta Falcons as they had a great season last year, but I think this one will be different."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they had several balls just bounce their way last year and I just think that they won't be so lucky this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand as they also lost they also lost their offensive coordinator during the off-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, so they will have a different play scheme since the new offensive coordinator is more conservative."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he's going to want to run the ball more and not pass as often?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From what his record shows, yes, he will be more into the running game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That could definitely change things, no doubt."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are you thinking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm thinking Dallas will have a letdown season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? Are you kidding?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, not at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With Prescott at quarterback and Elliott in the backfield? No way!!!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're great players but the offensive line has changed as several linemen left for other teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you see that making a big difference?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, as if the offensive line doesn't block for Prescott and Elliott, they won't be able to run the ball and Prescott will be pressured a lot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I see your point as if they don't have room to run through, its tough to gain much yardage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what I'm thinking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, we'll see once the season starts and find out which of us is right."
