"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is the most influential artist of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmm, I would have to say either Elvis or the Beatles, just given how popular and how much impact they had."
"__MUSIC__ Which one do you like better?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely the Beatles.  I couldn't name but a handful of Elvis songs."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed.  I like Elvis, and respect what he's done, but there's no comparison to the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Ok-- The Beatles, or Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ As much as I love the Stones, you just can't compare to the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ I have to agree with that.  What is your favorite Beatles' song?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I could pick just one-- there are too many good ones."
"__MUSIC__ Have you ever heard of Silver?"
"__MUSIC__ No."
"__MUSIC__ I've been really into one of their songs recently.  It's called Wham Bam Shang a Lang."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds funky."
"__MUSIC__ It is sooooo catchy, and it was on the Guardians soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of good soundtracks, you ever heard of Terrance Trent D'arby?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah."
"__MUSIC__ He did the theme for Beverly Hills Cop 3.  It's called Right Thing, Wrong Way.  I've been listening to that on repeat."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check that out."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, so which artist was the most influential on you personally?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd probably say Led Zeppelin.  I loved Robert Plant-- I even grew out my hair and dyed it blonde."
