"__STAR_WARS__ Ugh, I hate all the hype about Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ What? You don't like Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hate it! The movies are so bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Are you kidding? Have you seen them all?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, Just the one's that came out in the 90s."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, those one's were pretty bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, they were awful."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well you should try watching the old ones, or the new one that came out in 2015. They were so much better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? I kind of figured they were bad too."
"__STAR_WARS__ No, the 90s one's were awful but the new one especially is really good."
