"__BASKETBALL__ Well the Finals are almost here, who ya got?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Golden State and it's not even close."
"__BASKETBALL__ Not even close? You don't think LeBron can give them a series."
"__BASKETBALL__ Cleveland might get a game or two but the trophy is moving back out west this year."
"__BASKETBALL__ See I think it's a lot closer than you think.  Maybe even the Rockets can challenge Golden State."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Rockets won't even make it past San Antonio."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is really sad when a bunch of old guys can hang with the young guns."
"__BASKETBALL__ Shows just how good of a coach Pop is.  Always gets the best out of his players."
"__BASKETBALL__ I just think if Houston can get through, they have a chance of outscoring the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ A lot of teams have a chance, but they rarely do."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, true.  Boston or Washington in the Eastern semis?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Boston will take it now. They looked impressive out there tonight and I don't see them losing at TD Garden."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think so too, it will go 7 though for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah if Washington had home court advantage I'd lean their way."
"__BASKETBALL__ Such a close series but none of the games have been particularly tight except Game 2."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kind of crazy.  That's why neither has a chance against the Cavs."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think there's more than one reason but I gotcha."
"__BASKETBALL__ Should be interesting, we'll have to wait and see."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah I'm looking forward to it."
"__BASKETBALL__ Me too."
