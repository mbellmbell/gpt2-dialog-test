"__MOVIES__ Let's talk about movies"
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good to me"
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen fifty shade of grey?"
"__MOVIES__ Just the beginning"
"__MOVIES__ It didn't live up to the hype"
"__MOVIES__ I'm suprised they aired it on regular tv"
"__MOVIES__ They did?"
"__MOVIES__ Yup, that's where I saw the beginning. It was around 7 too"
"__MOVIES__ I would be really mad if I walked in and my kids were watching that on tv"
"__MOVIES__ Same here, I still can't believe it's on tv"
"__MOVIES__ That's not right, they shouldn't have done that."
"__MOVIES__ Even if they don't show anything, the way they talk"
"__MOVIES__ Yup exactly."
"__MOVIES__ It's just crazy."
"__MOVIES__ I dont love movies like that anyway, just wanted to watch it because of the book"
"__MOVIES__ They are never as good as the books"
"__MOVIES__ Nope and this wasn't an exception"
"__MOVIES__ I believe it"
"__MOVIES__ They need to find a better way to do book movies"
"__MOVIES__ I dont think it's possible"
