"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite movie as a kid?"
"__MOVIES__ When I was in the 5th grade, I really liked Galaxy Quest."
"__MOVIES__ Oh right, I remember seeing that. It has Alan Rickman in it, correct?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's right. Also Tim Allen and Sigourney Weaver."
"__MOVIES__ That came out at the peak of Tim Allen's career, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Well maybe it came out as it was just starting to wane."
"__MOVIES__ Rickman has such a great performance in that film."
"__MOVIES__ He really does. It's also one of the only films that has a lathe joke."
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember a joke about a lathe."
"__MOVIES__ When they're down on the planet fighting the rock monster, one of the other crew suggests that he try to craft a weapon and make some sort of rudimentary lathe."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of remember that. That's the guy who plays Monk who says that, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, the actor's name is Tony Shalhoub."
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember who directed the film?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't; can you look it up?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I just pulled it up. It was Dean Harisot."
"__MOVIES__ What else has he directed?"
"__MOVIES__ He also directed the Fun with Dick and Jane movie with Jim Carrey in it, and Red 2."
"__MOVIES__ I never saw the Red movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh they're okay."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll see if I can stream them."
