"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think about the horcruxes in Harry Potter?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, obviously they are important, what do you mean specifically?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it seems like he's a bit careless with them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, some of them didn't make sense. The snake specifically."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Also, the diary? He was very blase with leaving it about."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah you would think he'd be more careful with bits of his soul."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That always kind of bothered me about it. He was so powerful, but"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, so powerful, but he left himself exposed. It bothered me too."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ If only he would have hidden some of them better, what could Harry have done?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's a good question, probably nothing?"
