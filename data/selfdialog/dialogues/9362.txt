"__BASEBALL__ Where would you put the Phillies in terms of how many years away they are?"
"__BASEBALL__ They havent shown much progress this year so 3 years."
"__BASEBALL__ Thats a while to make a fanbase wait"
"__BASEBALL__ Theyve been patient before"
"__BASEBALL__ The problem is they have no pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ I havent seen much from their hitting either"
"__BASEBALL__ Thats another spot I thought we would see something"
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they have issues with their bullpen?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes but that can be easily fixed"
"__BASEBALL__ How?"
"__BASEBALL__ Slide some of those starters into the pen"
"__BASEBALL__ That would hamper the starting pitching though"
"__BASEBALL__ And those guys have not been good"
"__BASEBALL__ I think Aaron Nola is a reliver in the making"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he cant stay healthy"
"__BASEBALL__ So make him throw one inning a game if that"
"__BASEBALL__ Thats not a bad idea"
"__BASEBALL__ And then you put Velasquez as the closer"
"__BASEBALL__ Hes got the heat to do that"
"__BASEBALL__ Exactly it makes so much sense."
