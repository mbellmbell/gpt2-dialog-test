"__STAR_WARS__ One of these days, I'd like to see a back story on what happened with the New Republic after Luke destroyed the Empire."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, at least a short backstory on things going right, then taking a turn for the worst."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like how Kilo Ren turned."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or maybe the business as usual aspect.  While the Phantom Menace wasn't the best of movies, seeing the Senate was important to the whole of the Star Wars plot."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was, it showed that at one time the world had hit's problems but was stable to say the least."
"__STAR_WARS__ And that the Jedi Order was once well known, and were great peacekeepers."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd like to see how the Jedi worked under Luke as Grand Master."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, was he the same as Yoda?  Or did he have a different approach."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like about the vows of celibacy and poverty?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, was that something he did?  Or were there new rules allowing for families?"
