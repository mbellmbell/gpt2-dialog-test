"__MUSIC__ Do you like 90's Pop music at all?"
"__MUSIC__ Ehh kinda, depends on who you're talking about."
"__MUSIC__ Teh Backstreet Boys?"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, yes. I don't care who you are, where you're from or what you've done, you like them."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha! I totally agree, they get a bad reputation from people but they were good."
"__MUSIC__ People talk down about them because they are afraid to admit they like them!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree, what about Britney Spears?"
"__MUSIC__ Oops, I did it again."
"__MUSIC__ What did you do?"
"__MUSIC__ Nothing. I love me some Britney haha."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! She was so much better than Christina Aguillera."
"__MUSIC__ No way! Christina was amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree, but not as good as Britney."
"__MUSIC__ You are so wrong, you probably think N'Sync was better than backstreet Boys too."
"__MUSIC__ As a matter of fact I do."
"__MUSIC__ You're crazy! They weren't half as good."
"__MUSIC__ They had better artists."
"__MUSIC__ All they had was Justin Timberlake!"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, but who else was even half as successful as him from Bacstreet?"
"__MUSIC__ Touche my friend, touche."
