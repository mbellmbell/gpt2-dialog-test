"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you feel about the idea of more regular season games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would love if they would cut out one or two preseason games for regular season games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about risk of injury and health concerns for the players?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, on one hand, they are signing up to play a rough sport, so I think they should be aware of that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, but as it stands 16 games in 17 weeks is a rough schedule."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is. So, lose two preseason games, add an extra bye week, expand the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think NFL would ever consider a rotation for key positions? Like the MLB does with pitchers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be an interesting idea, and would open up spots for more players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think fans would be concerned about the quality of play from their team, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a concern, like if you have a Tom Brady and then a bunch of backups who play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ NFL season isn't as long as an MLB season, though, so maybe they'd only need to rotate and rest their star once or twice."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And MLB teams still manage to dominate even with pitching rotations, so I think NFL teams could too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you'd only add one or two extra games to a season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. There comes a point when a season is too long and it feels like there are pointless games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Again, like MLB and their 162 games per team per season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. I think no more than 20 games, max, for NFL. Long enough for a decent season, but not enough where games feel pointless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a good point. You don't want players in a rough sport playing games that don't matter much in the end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. And I like the current length of the NFL season. It doesn't overlap other things too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right between NBA and MLB, for the most part. And the season doesn't drag into too much extreme weather."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I wouldn't want it starting too much earlier than it does; too hot for players in all that gear in summer."
