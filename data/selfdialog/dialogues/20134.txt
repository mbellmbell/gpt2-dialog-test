"__MOVIES__ Did you ever see the movie Hairspray?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one? There have been several."
"__MOVIES__ I'm talking about the one from 1988 that had Sonny Bono, Ruth Brown, and Divine in it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah!  That was the best for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know there was another in 2007 or something wasn't there?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was the same story about Tracy Turnblad.  Did you not see it?"
"__MOVIES__ Nope, I just saw the original, probably over a dozen times."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was one of my favorites as a kid too.  I loved the dancing."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah.  That and Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."
"__MOVIES__ Those were the best!"
"__MOVIES__ Hairspray discussed some social issues too, though.  It had meaning and depth."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it really did.  I think it's also a musical?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it totally is.  It's on Broadway."
"__MOVIES__ Is it still playing?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure.  I'd love to see it if so."
"__MOVIES__ Well I'd say it's a classic from the eighties for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it is.  The soundtrack was great too."
"__MOVIES__ I love all that old music."
"__MOVIES__ Can you believe Ricki Lake played Traci?"
"__MOVIES__ No, that's crazy.  I used to love her show, too."
