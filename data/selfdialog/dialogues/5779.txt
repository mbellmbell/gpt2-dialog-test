"__STAR_WARS__ So what do you think of the new character Rey?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Shes interesting.  Has a lot of potential."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed.  She seems to have a lot of skill using the force and she hasnt even trained yet."
"__STAR_WARS__ Heck yeah she did!  Did you see that lightsaber battle?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Um, yeah!  She did pretty well against someone who has been training for years!"
"__STAR_WARS__ True, though that was a little unbelievable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, and she seems to be able to use the force against him pretty well too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Again, a little unbelievable."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well hopefully the explain this in the next movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ They better!  I want to know whats going to happen!"
