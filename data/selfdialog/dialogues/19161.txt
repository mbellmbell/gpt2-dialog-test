"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the movie Life yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I want to.  I heard it's pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, but they haven't released it for rent yet and I don't want to buy it."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither.  I did watch a movie called Passenger that is similar to it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it was good, but it was very different."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, if you watch it thinking it's a sci fi movie you will be disappointed.  It's more of a Psychological drama."
"__MOVIES__ I might like that since I am not much into sci fi movies anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Yes I feel like I was robbed because I was hoping for sci fi and I got drama."
"__MOVIES__ If you like sci fi, there is an older movie called The Fifth Element that is good."
"__MOVIES__ Who is in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich."
"__MOVIES__ Bruce Willis hasn't done a lot of sci fi movies."
"__MOVIES__ No he definitely hasn't, but this one was pretty awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I may check that out on Hulu."
"__MOVIES__ There haven't been a lot of new sci fi movies being released at the theatres recently."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've noticed that."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like there a lot more political movies coming out too."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that is unfortunate."
