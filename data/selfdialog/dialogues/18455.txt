"__MOVIES__ What about the 70's animated Tolkien film?"
"__MOVIES__ That one was good, I feel like it got the music better than the Jackson films did."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah totally. Except when frodo's little buddy sang at the end, that one fit in quite nicely."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. The spider was so much more badass int he animated version though. It can't be done as well with CGI or puppets would have been better."
"__MOVIES__ If only Jim Henson and Frank Oz had done There and Back Again,"
"__MOVIES__ The music and visuals would be so perfect. Well at least the animated version got the goblins right. The LOTR films were ok, but I always imagined goblins as being 'froggier'"
"__MOVIES__ True, and 15 birds is a creepy and innapropriate for children song I could have done without at such a young age."
"__MOVIES__ Catchy though."
"__MOVIES__ Very much so. The matrix, now there is a film which took folks on a ride"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that one got people thinking about essentially the 'brain in a jar' thought exercise"
"__MOVIES__ As did Blade Runner"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, like what is reality? If a computer can dream, is it not concious(sp)?"
"__MOVIES__ Or Short Circuit 1 and 2 for that matter."
"__MOVIES__ Johnny 5 Alive!!!!"
"__MOVIES__ That bridge he jumps off of is in Astoria Oregon"
"__MOVIES__ No kidding"
"__MOVIES__ Ninja Turtles 3 and the Ring 2 were also filmed there. Great atmosphere I guess"
"__MOVIES__ Those all felt unique"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, and Kindergarten Cop. the School in that film is in Astoria. Verry surrea to see a ficional setting in real life."
"__MOVIES__ I know, I met Paul Reubens at a young age and it was hard to dissasociate the actor from the character he played."
