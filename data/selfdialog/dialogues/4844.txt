"__MUSIC__ I'm really starting to enjoy making my own music."
"__MUSIC__ But I thought you said you didn't have any musical ability."
"__MUSIC__ I don't. I can't sing or play any instruments. But I'm on Soundcloud and Reverbnation."
"__MUSIC__ What? I don't understand. What music are you making, then?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it's kind of a hobby. I make tracks with my ZOOM portable audio recorder."
"__MUSIC__ How, though, if you can't play or sing anything?"
"__MUSIC__ It's easy. It's called 'Ambient' or 'Electronic' music."
"__MUSIC__ Like Brian Eno or Kraftwerk or the Aphex Twins or The Orb?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I'm not that good, but I try. I like to play non copy-written music, then mess with the tracks."
"__MUSIC__ Like most classical music? Those are too old, usually, for a copyright. Or sound effects collections."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. For example, I'll put Holst's 'The Planets' on an old record-player in another room."
"__MUSIC__ Then what? Add the sound of a train passing by and slow it down 300 percent, or speed it up?"
"__MUSIC__ Sometimes yes, actually! I'll record the sounds from a distance, play them backwards, change their speed."
"__MUSIC__ Well, that might be plagiarism, if you're not careful!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, no, when I'M done with the sounds, there's no way to recognize them."
"__MUSIC__ You run the ambient sounds you record through some kind of audio software?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, my old Mixcraft software, and I'll use weird recording techniques, like use a toilet paper tube around the microphone."
"__MUSIC__ Making your own shotgun microphone. Interesting. I'd like to hear some of these."
"__MUSIC__ I've got about 220 followers on Soundcloud now. Just started on Reverbnation."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, my gosh. Maybe you can sell some of your tracks to a video game company or something!"
