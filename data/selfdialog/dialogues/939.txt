"__MUSIC__ You've been to a lot of alternative rock concerts, haven't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Over a hundred, back in the 90s mostly. I really loved mosh pits."
"__MUSIC__ What was it about mosh pits you liked so much?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved the way when the band was happy, and the audience was happy, and they were all singing songs everyone knew the words to, and that feeling of all being one."
"__MUSIC__ What was the best mosh pit ypu wee ever in?"
"__MUSIC__ Flaming Lips at Lollapalooza in 1994. They were singing this song, Turn It On, and the crowd started bouncing."
"__MUSIC__ You mean literally bouncing, like up and down?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. And there was a bubble machine, and the sunshine suddenly made this glow over the crowd, and there was this feeling of pure joy on everyone's faces."
"__MUSIC__ You could tell everyone all felt the same happiness?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and I started giggling as we were all bouncing up and down, and the happiness floated out of all of us into the air just like an aura."
"__MUSIC__ What was the worst mosh pit you were ever in?"
"__MUSIC__ Weezer, at a big venue where I was down in the pit. I'd always wanted to body surf and never had, and everyone was body surfing, and I thought this is the band to do it because they're so mild."
"__MUSIC__ Uh oh, don't tell me- you body surfed and got hurt?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I didn't body surf. I was thinking about it, and suddenly out of nowhere a body surfer got tossed through the air, and there wasn't a lot of people around me to catch him, and he slammed into my head."
"__MUSIC__ OH MY GOD. How bad were you hurt?"
"__MUSIC__ I was knocked to the ground, then taken to the medical office. I was pale white, blood dripping from a loose tooth, and complaining of shoulder pain."
"__MUSIC__ Did you have to go to the hospital?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they advised I go home. I refused because I said Violent Femmes was playing soon and I wanted to stay and see them."
"__MUSIC__ And so you stayed at the concert even though you were hurt?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, with a blanket around me the medical people gave me. When I went to the doctor the next day, I had four broken teeth, neck and head pain, and torn shoulder muscles. It took months for the shoulders to heal, and the teeth had to be pulled. You hear about mosh pit injuries and hope it won't happen to you, but when it does, it's usually bad."
