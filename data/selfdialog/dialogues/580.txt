"__MUSIC__ Hey have you heard that Adele song, rolling in the deep?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I really like that song. Adele is a pretty great artist."
"__MUSIC__ She has a very strong voice. What's your overall favorite genre?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say I'm honestly less of a pop fan and more of an alternative rock fan."
"__MUSIC__ Really? Tell me a few of your favorite artists and I'll tell you mine."
"__MUSIC__ Well I'm a big fan of the red hot chili peppers, Popevil, Three Doors Down, and Breaking Benjamin."
"__MUSIC__ That's quite a list you've got there! Mine are Peter Bjorn and Jon, The Lumineers, and Mumford and Sons."
"__MUSIC__ Seems like we have quite different tastes in music. Do you like The Killers?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I love them! You know I saw them at the Music Midtown Festival a few months back."
"__MUSIC__ Really? How are they live?"
"__MUSIC__ Let's put it this way. They blew away every single other artist there, and The Lumineers were there as well."
"__MUSIC__ Well now you've got me jonesing to see them live! I'm definitely going to have to look around for some tickets soon."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that Rise Against is playing in the area soon. They're another one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Seems like you've got some eclectic tastes when it comes to music. Who else are you into?"
"__MUSIC__ Well don't call me an Indie snob, but I also like Neutral Milk Hotel, Tegan and Sera, and Death Cab For Cutie."
"__MUSIC__ I won't call you an Indie snob. Most of those artists have gone mainstream by now anyway."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. I don't know what Death Cab is considered these days. I guess still the Indie genre?"
"__MUSIC__ I suppose I would say so. A lot of people would say they've sold out."
"__MUSIC__ I never say an artist has sold out unless they totally change their style to something that panders, which they have not done at all. Ben Gibbard is a genius."
"__MUSIC__ You've got that right! Now we've really got something we can agree on."
