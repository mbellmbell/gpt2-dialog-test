"__STAR_WARS__ I heard somewhere that someone died on the set of the new Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What?  That didn't happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought I heard it somewhere."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think you're obviously mistaken."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, I know what it was.  It was actually Harrison Ford dying on the set."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean his character Han Solo in the last film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah.  Guess I got confused."
"__STAR_WARS__ You guess?  You were way off."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, so many people die in these films it's hard to keep track."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's not that hard!"
