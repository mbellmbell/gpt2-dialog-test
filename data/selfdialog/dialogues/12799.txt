"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think is the rising star in the AFC East division?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's a tough one! But I'm going for Trey Flowers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Flowers started the final eight games of the regular season, finishing with seven sacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, and he capped his year with a key sack of Matt Ryan in the Super Bowl that pushed the Falcons out of field goal range, likely saving the Patriots' comeback bid."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. Flowers has a long way to go until he is considered in the same company as Khalil Mack or Von Miller, but his arrow is pointing up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. I think DeVante Parker would be my pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is definitely up there. What's your reason?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Parker was one of Miami's best players in spring practices, and was hard to defend and made various big plays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I expect Parker to surpass 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career and have the type of breakout season the Dolphins have been waiting for."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be something! I really hope he does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Jets defensive lineman, Leonard Williams?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't he already a star?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea, but I still think he's on the rise."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What makes you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's only 23 and hasn't reached his ceiling yet. Scary, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. He has had two good years, but he's still learning the nuances of the position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His defensive line coach certainly agrees and believes in Williams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's awesome. Williams is improving as a pass-rusher and said his goal is at least 10 sacks and to make the Pro Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so,  he made seven sacks last year and was a Pro Bowl replacement."
