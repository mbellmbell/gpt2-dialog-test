"__DISNEY__ hey did you watch the new finding nemo movie?"
"__DISNEY__ no i didnt even know a new one came out"
"__DISNEY__ yeah it was called finding dory"
"__DISNEY__ oh, wow that sounds crazy awesome"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah i didnt get a chance to catch it but i was just glad to hear a sequel had come out"
"__DISNEY__ good point, didnt the first one come out a while back?"
"__DISNEY__ yeah it did, so most of the people who watched it were probably people in their twenties"
"__DISNEY__ that sounds about right, the first one was so good"
"__DISNEY__ yeah, i liked nemo and how much he tried despite his small fin"
"__DISNEY__ he was surely a trooper, i wonder if the new one lived up to the hype."
