"__HARRY_POTTER__ Every single time I see the Harry Potter movies, I find something new in them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I do too, decades in to watching them."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The whole of them are just so full."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think one of my favorite scenes from the movies is the one where Harry, Ron, Neville and a couple other Gryffindors are sitting in the bunk room eating the different magical sweets"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ While so much is wrong in their world, they are just being kids."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ My favorite thing about Harry Potter in general is just when they're in school and nothing is going wrong. Just magical kids being magical kids."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love the classes and Quidditch, and all the little magical details of Hogwarts."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The moving staircases. The magical pictures."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The little details that make the place something magical, make me want to go there."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Of course, then there is the troll in the dungeon, makes me rethink wanting to go."
