"__ROCK__ Who is your favorite rock singer of all time?"
"__ROCK__ If I had to choose just one, I'd say Eddie Vedder."
"__ROCK__ I love Pearl Jam, which album do you like best?"
"__ROCK__ Ten was definitely their best album."
"__ROCK__ I agree. Vs. and Vitalogy were great too, but Ten was like nothing I'd ever heard before."
"__ROCK__ Yes, and their music videos were amazing - especially for the song Jeremy!"
"__ROCK__ Jeremy's video still gives me goosebumps when I watch it."
"__ROCK__ Me too! When the boy is running in the woods you can really feel his rage."
"__ROCK__ And it was chilling how easy it was to relate to the angry kid!"
"__ROCK__ Exactly! Because most everyone knew a kid like that in grade school and had no idea what they were dealing with at home."
