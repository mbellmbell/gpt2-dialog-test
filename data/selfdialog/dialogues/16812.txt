"__MOVIES__ I grew up watching Singing in the Rain."
"__MOVIES__ I should re-watch that. It was really good."
"__MOVIES__ I had a crush on Donald O'Connor."
"__MOVIES__ Not Gene Kelly?"
"__MOVIES__ Nah, he didn't do it for me."
"__MOVIES__ Huh. Y'know Debbie Reynolds was only like nineteen when she did it."
"__MOVIES__ That's way too young."
"__MOVIES__ It was way too young for Carrie Fisher and Star Wars too, though."
"__MOVIES__ Hollywood is just messed up when it comes to kids."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Still, I think they both survived it. Before they died there was a documentary..."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah! I've been meaning to check that out."
"__MOVIES__ Apparently they lived next to each other and bantered all the time."
"__MOVIES__ It was insanely tragic they died so close together but..."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah no, I feel you. It was kinda poetic at the same time."
"__MOVIES__ Mhm. I was still super surprised, though."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Carrie was rockin' it in the Star Wars movies."
"__MOVIES__ They're doing pretty well!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah! Have you seen Rogue One yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet. I'm excited for it though. Everybody says they haven't had as much fun watching Star Wars since the '80s."
"__MOVIES__ Hahaha. Also known as 'this is so much better than the prequels.' But yeah it was great."
