"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Manning brothers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they are a little overrated, actually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What? I think they are both great players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't get me wrong, they are, but like I said....they aren't the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree there are better players then them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't even remember their names, Peyton and...."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eli. Eli is the younger one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotcha, I feel like they've been a part of the NFL forever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really have, I'm surprised they haven't retired yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Peyton is a part of the Patriots, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, not sure what team Eli is on though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably aren't on the same team, I'm assuming?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not, conflict of interest maybe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, all I'm saying is I'm sure they'll retire soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I feel like they'll play until they can't even walk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many superbowls have they been both in, do you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, too many to count."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I know the Patriots just were in the Superbowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and lost, if I remember correctly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You remembered correctly indeed!"
