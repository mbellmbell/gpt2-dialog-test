"__MOVIES__ Have you ever watched the movie Lonesome Dove?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I've watched it several times. It came out in the 80's didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it did. It was a miniseries on tv."
"__MOVIES__ I don't normally care for Westerns, but this movie is a classic."
"__MOVIES__ I think so too! Who was your favorite character?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Gus, played by Robert DuVall."
"__MOVIES__ I loved his character, but Tommy Lee Jones who played the Captain was mine."
"__MOVIES__ Do you have any other favorite Western movies?"
"__MOVIES__ True Grit, probably."
"__MOVIES__ It was good, but I hate movies where they show animals dying and that horse dying after he was run to death, just broke my heart."
"__MOVIES__ Right, I had forgotten about that scene."
"__MOVIES__ I can hardly stand to watch a movie when I see an animal dies."
"__MOVIES__ Me either. I always watch for the credits at the end to see that statement they make saying no animals were harmed in the making of this film."
"__MOVIES__ hahaha I thought I was the only person who did that."
"__MOVIES__ Back to Lonesome Dove..... do you have a favorite scene? Mine is when Gus is dying and the Captain is by his bedside."
"__MOVIES__ And Gus says....'By gol Woodrow, it's been quite a party.'......"
"__MOVIES__ Doesn't that just tug at your heart?"
"__MOVIES__ Totally."
"__MOVIES__ It's going to be on television again this Sunday. Want to watch the movie together?"
"__MOVIES__ Love to!"
