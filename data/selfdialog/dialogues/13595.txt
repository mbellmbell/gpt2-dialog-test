"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited about the upcoming Packers games?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I'm a huge fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they had some great draft picks off-season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was not impressed by the draft choices."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why do you say that about the draft choices?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because the packers need a running back, and they did not spend a high pick on one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose that is true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is definitely true, and now they are stuck with depending solely on Rogers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not all bad because Rogers is great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, he is the best quarterback in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, and he is still as strong as ever."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But his receivers are a joke this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, and the packers don't seem concerned about it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have all 30 or older receivers, and that will hurt them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the two young receivers they drafted?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will take a couple years before the new receivers can contribute."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the NFL is a tough place to come up quickly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is a good chance that all their offensive picks this year will be wash outs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But I am still hopeful that the packers could win it all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I am hopeful as well for the packers."
