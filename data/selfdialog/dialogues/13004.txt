"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who were you rooting for in the Super Bowl last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Broncos, of course!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, silly question I know..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Where did you watch the game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was at my best friend's house...rooting for the Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How upset were you that the Broncos won?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was pretty angry at the time but I got over it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope the Broncos can do as well this year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I honestly don't know.  There are a lot of great teams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True.  It would be nice to see the Panthers do well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they will.  A lot of money goes into that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they sure do have a lot of talent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, they're also surrounded with some controversy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like every time is sooner or later!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I just don't let it impact my enjoyment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't either.  Wouldn't it be amazing if it was the same two teams in the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure would!  It would be unlikely though..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know but I would love too see the Panthers get a rematch!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If that happens we'll go together!"
