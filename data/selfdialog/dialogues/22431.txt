"__DISNEY__ I can't believe how many Disney movies have come out over the years. How many can you name?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, let me think. Bambi, Cinderella, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Alice in Wonderland."
"__DISNEY__ You're pretty good! Can you think of any others off the top of your head?"
"__DISNEY__ What about the one with the bears? I can remember them singing about bear necessities, but I can't recall the name of the movie."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yeah! Now I can't remember it either!"
"__DISNEY__ That's funny. I know Disney made Lady and the Tramp, and Brother Bear, but I don't think it's in either of those two movies."
"__DISNEY__ No, definitely not. Maybe it was the Jungle Book?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I believe that's the one."
"__DISNEY__ I'm going to have to dig out my old VHS movies now and watch some of these great Disney movies! Thanks for the reminder!"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I'll have to bring the family over to watch them with you then. Sounds like fun!"
