"__DISNEY__ Peter Pan is definitely one of the most well known Disney movies of all times."
"__DISNEY__ I totally agree, I think everyone knows who Peter Pan is!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and even more so Tinkerbell and Captain Hook!"
"__DISNEY__ So true. Plus there were so many versions that came out."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, like Hook and the live verison of Peter Pan, not just the cartoon!"
"__DISNEY__ There was also that newer one, but I can't remember what it was called."
"__DISNEY__ I think it was called Pan?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! That's it! It was about the beginning of Hook and Peter Pan's relationship."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! It was so unexpected, I would never imagine they'd be helping each other."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, considering the whole animated movie is The Lost Boys at war with the Pirates!"
