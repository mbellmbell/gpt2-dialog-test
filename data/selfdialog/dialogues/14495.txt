"__HORROR__ Are you a fan of horror movies?"
"__HORROR__ Generally I am, though, there are some that are a little too vulgar for my taste."
"__HORROR__ What movie do you think is your favorite horror movie of all time?"
"__HORROR__ That's actually a toss up between Alien and Aliens, both are great."
"__HORROR__ Wait.  Alien isn't a horror film, that's a thriller."
"__HORROR__ I completely disagree, Alien is the best type of horror.  One where the horror isn't how much blood is on the screen, but instead the amount of fright and anxiety you feel during intense scenes."
"__HORROR__ So you don't like bloody, gory horror movies?"
"__HORROR__ No, I enjoy those as well.  I'm just more impressed by the ability to generate horror without resorting to gore."
"__HORROR__ Well, if you had to pick a gory horror movie as your favorite, which one would it be?"
"__HORROR__ I'm thinking the latest Evil Dead movie would be high on my list."
