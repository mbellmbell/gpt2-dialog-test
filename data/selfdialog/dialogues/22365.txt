"__DISNEY__ Are you going to see that new Frozen movie when it comes out?"
"__DISNEY__ No probably not."
"__DISNEY__ Aw, why not?"
"__DISNEY__ I've never been a big fan of animated films."
"__DISNEY__ Those are the best kind of Disney films though!"
"__DISNEY__ They're good for some people, I just prefer the live action approach."
"__DISNEY__ Because it feels more real?"
"__DISNEY__ Yea, that and it's easier to connect to a character when it's someone giving human emotion and reactions on screen."
"__DISNEY__ That makes sense."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe one day if you're being nice I'll go see one with you."
