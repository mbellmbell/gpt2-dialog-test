"__MUSIC__ Which band is better, the Beatles or the Rolling Stones?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, the age old question of Classic Rock!"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, this is the big one! I know what I'd say, but curious about your opinion."
"__MUSIC__ I've got to go with the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. I'd say the Stones were better."
"__MUSIC__ Heres why I say Beatles - With the Beatles, you've got Lennon and McCarthy, two of the greatest songwriters of all time."
"__MUSIC__ It's true that the Beatles benefited from their separate geniuses, but for me the Stones were more consistently great."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles turned out some weird stuff, but you can just ignore it if you want to. Their hits, though, can't be topped."
"__MUSIC__ You want hits? The Rolling Stones have a few hits of their own."
"__MUSIC__ They do, but I don't think they match the Beatles for range."
"__MUSIC__ Sympathy for the Devil, Satisfaction, Brown Sugar - the list goes on."
"__MUSIC__ Sure, but did they ever make a song like Eleanor Rigby?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe not, but they made a lot of great songs."
"__MUSIC__ So did the Beatles, and I'd argue their songs were greater."
"__MUSIC__ The Beatles are a great band who is also overhyped."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it's possible to be overhyped when you're the greatest band ever!"
"__MUSIC__ Says you! I'm going with the Rolling Stones."
"__MUSIC__ The Stones are Top 5, for sure Maybe Top 3."
"__MUSIC__ Same for the Beatles. Great, but not the greatest."
"__MUSIC__ We'll have to agree to disagree."
