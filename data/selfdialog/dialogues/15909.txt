"__ROCK__ what do you think about the new bands out today?"
"__ROCK__ some are ok but i like a lot of the more classic stuff."
"__ROCK__ like the stones? and the who?"
"__ROCK__ yes they are okay but i always liked the edgier stuff like the ramones and the stooges."
"__ROCK__ so youre into classic punk rock?"
"__ROCK__ sure and some other genres too but nothing beats the raw energy of the older stuff."
"__ROCK__ thats true a lot of the newer bands do all sound the same."
"__ROCK__ yes i agree, most rip off the older bands. todays seem so fake  like they try to hard."
"__ROCK__ yes i see alot of that but rock and roll is here to stay."
"__ROCK__ haha yes it is thank goodness. what would we do without it?"
