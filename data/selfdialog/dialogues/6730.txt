"__STAR_WARS__ Dude, did you see the latest Star Wars movie"
"__STAR_WARS__ I know. It was sad. No Luke Skywalker or Han Solo or anything!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Um, well, yes, it's a prequel. Rogue One is actually about the events that led up to the very first Star Wars film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Couldn't it have had Han Solo though? I mean, he existed in that time period, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, maybe, but I don't think it would have made sense. He wasn't doing anything related to the storyline at that time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Even better! We could have seen him in his early days."
"__STAR_WARS__ OK, but Harrison Ford is pretty old now. I mean, it probably would have been a younger actor to play young Han Solo"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nah man, CGI! We could have had a badass Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is your obsession with Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo..."
