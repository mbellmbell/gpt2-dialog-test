"__MUSIC__ Do you remember the early 2000s rock scene?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean exactly? Nu metal?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah, I'm talking about the rock revival stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, so like The Strokes, The White Stripes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Franz Ferdinand, Jet, et cetera.?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, exactly what I'm talking about. How do you look back on that time period."
"__MUSIC__ It's strange. It's strange that these bands all got huge kind of out of nowhere."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed. For sure some of them had the aesthetic, I'm thinking The Strokes and The Killers, but there wasn't any clear precedent to them in mainstream pop."
"__MUSIC__ I wish the rock scene had stayed strong. It definitely gave a boost to indie rock, but the popularity of bands like The Strokes and The White Stripes waned."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. It is interesting to note, however, that Jack White has had many bands and remains a household name."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he had Death Weather and the Racontuers right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and super recently he co-wrote and co-performed a song on Beyonce's most recent album."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, didn't realize that! What song?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Don't Hurt Yourself. He even sings on it!"
"__MUSIC__ Wow! That has to be some of the highest profile stuff anyone from that rock revival is doing now."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think the average pop music consumer knows about the Yeah Yeah Yeah's because of Rock Band."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, 'Maps' is on that."
"__MUSIC__ It must have been tough for all those bands, to be young and rise in fame so quickly."
"__MUSIC__ And then to have it all go away so fast!"
"__MUSIC__ It's a shame. I think there is nothing wrong with good bands making money."
"__MUSIC__ Agreed, those who claim that bands sell out by putting their song on commercials are ridiculous. Bands gotta pay the bills."
