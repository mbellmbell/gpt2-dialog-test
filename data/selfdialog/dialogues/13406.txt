"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL teams do you think have the best logos?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that the Cowboys star is iconic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's only iconic because there's a lot of Cowboy fans that say its iconic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not a Cowboy fan, but you have to admit, the logo is iconic. I personally don't like their color scheme regardless."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Browns probably have one of the worse color schemes and logos. I don't understand it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't either. It's so boring."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's just a color. The helmet is orange."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what makes it even worse. It doesn't make any sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do think that the Rams have a pretty cool helmet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess, but it looked better when it was yellow and blue. These days, their color scheme is gold and dark blue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I don't like their color scheme either. I wish they would go back to their old colors."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cardinals also have a pretty boring logo. It's just a bird."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'm not a fan of it. That's another team with a logo and concept that makes no sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's because the team moved from St. Louis where a Cardinal name and logo makes more sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish more teams would just change their names when they change cities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sometimes it's just too much money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's part of the reason some fanbases never get into their teams. Franchises don't take pride in relating to the city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I agree with that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Personally, I think I just don't like the logo of any team that isn't mine."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least you can be honest about it."
