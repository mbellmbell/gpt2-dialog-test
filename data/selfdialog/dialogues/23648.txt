"__DISNEY__ Hey, can we listen to the Frozen soundtrack?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure, that sounds fine to me. I dig on that soundtrack for sure."
"__DISNEY__ It's a really good one. I must have heard it a hundred times and I still like it every time."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, the singing is great. Hey, remember that thing-- the lovely and talented Adele Dazeem!"
"__DISNEY__ What? Is she one of the singers?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I mean, no, the singer's name is Idina Menzel. But there was some awards show where John Travolta was introducing her and said her name wrong."
"__DISNEY__ I mean, I'm... I'm not a Broadway person, so I don't know anything about that."
"__DISNEY__ That's okay. It was a thing for like two weeks, like four years ago. I'm not surprised you don't remember it."
"__DISNEY__ Okay. Well, whatever. Let's listen to the Frozen soundtrack!"
"__DISNEY__ Yes!"
