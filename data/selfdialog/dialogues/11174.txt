"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the most emotional NFL moment you witnessed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ By the far the Saints return to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard about the game but I just moved to New Orleans and it seems like everybody talks it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah it was a Monday night game in the Superdome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did the Saints play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only our biggest rival, the dirty birds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Atalanta Falcons?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes haha. We call them the dirty birds."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Gotcha, so was that Monday night game the game when that dude blocked the punt?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sure was and the dude is named Steve Gleason, bascially considered a hero in New Orleans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I see people all the time wearing Gleason shirts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Steve was diagnosed with ALS a few seasons after his historic punt block and all the shirts you see are for his charity called 'No White Flags'"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow, that's heartbreaking."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's very sad but Steve's a class act, he still supports the Saints and is always on the field at any Saints home game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll for sure look for him next time you take me to Saints game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who says I'm going to take you to any games this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope you're joking rite now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am I am, don't worry you can actually come to the Monday night game with me this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Great! Who are the Saints playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Vikings in the Superdome!"
