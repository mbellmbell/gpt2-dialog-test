"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see game 2 between the Celtics and Cavs?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I did. It was a sad sight to behold."
"__BASKETBALL__ What is going on with the Celtics?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think that they were simply overmatched."
"__BASKETBALL__ Lebron just did whatever he wanted to out there."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes. He gave them 30 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ He also had 7 assists and only 1 turnover."
"__BASKETBALL__ Kyrie also pitched in a respectable 23 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true. Kevin Love had 21 points as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you know the Celtics also had 20 turnovers."
"__BASKETBALL__ I did and that is one of the main reasons they lost the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs also shut down the Celtics' star player."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, Thomas only finished with only 2 points."
"__BASKETBALL__ Wow, how can a team win when their star player plays so poorly."
"__BASKETBALL__ The only way that can happen is everyone else has to pick up the scoring."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, that didn't happen for the Celtics."
