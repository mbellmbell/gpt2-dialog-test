"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you catch the Chargers game last night?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No. I had to work. Who did they play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they lose again?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes. And I was rooting for their team too"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who the Chargers or the Lions?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Chargers.It seems like the last two games they played were losses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Alot of people watch these games out because they like the sport"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you ?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the sport and certain teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So your saying that even if a losing team is playing they watch because they just like football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Also these teams get alot of hype and publicity to sell tickets"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know they really hype some of these players up but when you watch them play its not that good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I the 49er are just a little overhyped I should say"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. Their players aren't that good- the rookies either"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Some of the players should just retire"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They wait until they are late 40's early 50's or so"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So is that why they are called the 49ers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, their players are 49 years old. Ha ha ha."
