"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any thoughtse on how you think the 49ers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they couldn't do much worse than last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year was terrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. Only two wins and fourteen losses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who did they beat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both times they won against the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Rams must be a really bad team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, they had more wins last season than the 49ers did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they need to get a new coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did get a new one for this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His name is Kyle Shanahan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, maybe he can turn the team around."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. It's not even that fun watching them anymore."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I mean what's the point of watching if you know they're going to lose?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm going to give this season a chance and see if the new coach makes a difference."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'll check out the first couple of games, too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be great if they get back to being the winning type of team they used to be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well it won't be long until we find out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So we should watch the first game together."
