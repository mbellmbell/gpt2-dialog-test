"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think are some of the best NFL prizes? I think I have some idea."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I know they've used team trophies. This seems to be a good structure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The one they use right now is the Vince Lombardi, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's correct. He coached the Green Bay Packers to a couple of Super Bowl wins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A brand new Vince Lombardi Trophy is given to the winning team each year, and they keep permanent control of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A little different from the Stanford vs. Cal college football games when they compete for temporary possession of an axe."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that's an interesting rivalry."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Lombardi trophies are created by Tiffany & Co. They're said to be worth between $25,000 to $300,000."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not bad for just a cup."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A sterling silver cup! Its quite an accomplishment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Then there are the Super Bowl rings as well. Some players have a few."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Super Bowl losing teams get rings also. I hear they're not generally worn."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can understand why."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Mmm hmm, and the conference champions receive trophies too. The NFC receive the George Halas Trophy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And I know the AFC champs get the Lamar Hunt Trophy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. Plus the winning team players get a conference championship ring"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Guess I wouldn't mind that, if I played ball at that level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ With the awards, I watch for the MVP, Rookie of the Year, and the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those are good ones at the individual level."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're all good I think. Those are the ones I tend to like."
