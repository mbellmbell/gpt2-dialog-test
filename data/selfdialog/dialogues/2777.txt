"__MUSIC__ So, who is your favorite band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's easy!  It's The Grateful Dead!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I miss Jerry Garcia, it's like another 'day the music died' feel ya know?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but there's a bunch of Dead tribute bands out there, so you'll still be able to get your live Deadhead fix."
"__MUSIC__ Which Dead tribute band do you think is the best out of them all?"
"__MUSIC__ Hands down, it's The Schwag."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that band out of St. Louis?  I've heard they have a massive following too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, there used to be festivals surrounding them.  One was called Schwagstock...was held at Camp Zoe every year."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen them play at EarthDance in 2009, it was amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ I just love jam bands like The Dead & The Schwag."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know!  It's amazing how they can all just start playing whatever they want, and everyone just picks up the melody & beat."
"__MUSIC__ That's the beautiful part about it!"
"__MUSIC__ So, have you heard if any of the other members of The Dead are going to be getting together anytime soon for another concert or anything?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I sure haven't.  It'd be one hell of a show if they did!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, what they SHOULD do is start having those laser shows with Grateful Dead music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh you mean like they do for Pink Floyd?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly like that!  Do you know how many people would go to that?"
"__MUSIC__ There's a FORTUNE to be made with that type of concert!"
"__MUSIC__ I really do miss The Grateful Dead concerts."
"__MUSIC__ Well, at least we still have the music, with that, the band will live on forever."
