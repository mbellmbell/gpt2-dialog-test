"__MUSIC__ Hey, what are your thoughts on Bon Iver's latest CD '22, A Million'?"
"__MUSIC__ Trying way too hard. Like it's tailor made for the Urban Outfitters crowd."
"__MUSIC__ That's what I thought."
"__MUSIC__ What kind of song name is '21 M♢♢N WATER'? It's all so extra."
"__MUSIC__ What made his earlier music so haunting was the simplicity. I'm not a fan of this new direction."
"__MUSIC__ What was your favorite Bon Iver song from his earlier stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ I've always loved 'Holocene' from the 2011 'Bon Iver' album."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! I just want to grab a blanket and sit in a cabin in the woods."
"__MUSIC__ That's his whole aesthetic. Or was his whole aesthetic."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know Justin Vernon came up with the idea for Bon Iver when he had mono?"
"__MUSIC__ I did know that? He was cooped up in his dad's cabin in Wisconsin, right?"
"__MUSIC__ The stuff of legends, no? That's probably why his first CD is so melancholy."
"__MUSIC__ A Pitchfork review I read of '22 Million' tries to argue that it's experimental but they are still 'deeply felt songs about uncertainty.'"
"__MUSIC__ I mean, I guess I could see that. The sound of the songs doesn't show it as much, but maybe the lyrics do."
"__MUSIC__ Like, 'I'm unorphaned in our northern lights / Dedicoding every daemon.' What does that even mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Who knows. But it feels like it should be deep."
"__MUSIC__ Or in '33 GOD'-- 'When we leave this room it's gone.' Trippy, man."
"__MUSIC__ Not the masterpiece of 'Re: Stacks' but maybe I'll give it another listen. With the lyrics in front of me."
"__MUSIC__ Otherwise you'll miss the whole thing. I'll give it a run through again."
"__MUSIC__ Then. listen to 'Skinny Love' on repeat after it's all done."
