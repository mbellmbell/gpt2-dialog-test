"__DISNEY__ Did you know that the Lion King is based on Hamlet?"
"__DISNEY__ Really? I've never heard that before."
"__DISNEY__ I just found out the other day. It really puts things in perspective."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah. I've never thought of it like that. So Simba would be Hamlet?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, exactly. And he mopes around and then comes to terms with taking revenge for his father."
"__DISNEY__ On Scar or Claudius."
"__DISNEY__ Right. It's amazing how Shakespeare plays still influence us today."
"__DISNEY__ It is! Are there any other Disney movies like that?"
"__DISNEY__ Not that I know of, but I bet one or two have some influences!"
"__DISNEY__ I'll have to watch and look!"
