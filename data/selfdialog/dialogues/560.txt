"__MUSIC__ So are the Velvet Underground really that influential?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yes, I would definitely say so. Have you heard the Brian Eno quote about them?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I don't think so..."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he basically said that not all that many people went out and bought the first Velvet Underground album, but everyone that did started a band."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, that's interesting, the idea being that they made a strong impact and inspired people?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, definitely! And what they were doing was definitely very strange and original."
"__MUSIC__ See, I've only heard the first album and it just sounds kind of trashy and noisy to me, with out-of-tune guitars."
"__MUSIC__ Well, yeah, and the Velvet Underground probably were not especially good at playing rock and roll the way, say, The Doors were."
"__MUSIC__ The point was that they were kind of untalented?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, well, not so much that as that their music forced listeners to rethink their idea of what rock music is."
"__MUSIC__ By it being kind of aggressive, weird, and confrontational, you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! And defying expectations, with long songs, and noisy songs, and dirgey/depressing songs."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, let's talk about their lyrics for a minute. I mean, you have a song like 'Heroin...'"
"__MUSIC__ Right, and I think that's where Lou Reed's literary aspirations are at their strongest."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think he was inspired by Beatnik writers like William Burroughs?"
"__MUSIC__ Very much so. I see what Reed as doing there is using pop lyrics to tell a true, bleak story of being a drug addict."
"__MUSIC__ And that hadn't really been done yet."
"__MUSIC__ Nope, not by the mainstream. Maybe by some more underground or obscure blues or jazz artists, but not something many people would have heard."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what about the last song on the album, 'European Son'?"
"__MUSIC__ I always saw that as a poem set to really wild, avant-garde music, which Reed dedicated to his poetry teacher, Delmore Schwartz."
