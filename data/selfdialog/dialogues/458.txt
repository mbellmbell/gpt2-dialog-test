"__MUSIC__ Hey, what's this song? I'm really digging it."
"__MUSIC__ It's a new song from the DJ Khaled album. It's called 'I'm the One.'"
"__MUSIC__ Is that Justin Bieber?"
"__MUSIC__ You bet it is!"
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to the album all the way through?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not actually all out on Spotify yet. There is a Rihanna song and another collaboration with Calvin Harris."
"__MUSIC__ When does the album come out, then?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it actually came out June 23? Spotify is just catching up."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like he's got some good collaborations. Who else is on the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely! A song with Alician Keys, one with Migos, one with Chance the Rapper, one with Beyonce."
"__MUSIC__ With Beyonce? No way!"
"__MUSIC__ Haven't heard it yet though. Come on Spotify!"
"__MUSIC__ DJ Khaled keeps screaming 'DJ Khaled!' Is that like his trademark?"
"__MUSIC__ He does that all the time! Quite annoying actually."
"__MUSIC__ Like, we know this is the DJ Khaled album. He doesn't need to keep remind us!"
"__MUSIC__ What if Justin Bieber screamed 'Justin Bieber' every 15 seconds?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh geez, I'm constantly trying to forget that I'm listening to Justin Bieber."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. This is more up his alley, though. No more Latin music collaborations."
"__MUSIC__ I still can't believe he didn't know the words to 'Despacito'!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe he'll have better luck on this song."
