"__MUSIC__ Have you ever had an artist that you're supposed to like but don't?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure I know what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ Like an artist that all of your favorite artists like or all your friends with similar taste like or who all the critics are hyping."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I get what you're saying now. I for sure have had that happen, Sonic Youth is my prime example."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my god! Same!"
"__MUSIC__ Right, like I know they're super influential and great, but when I hunker down and listen to a record I don't connect."
"__MUSIC__ That's the litmus test. If I'm not connecting after listening multiple times after years, I know it's not for me."
"__MUSIC__ Still disappointing to know that you're missing something."
"__MUSIC__ I know. I feel this way about a lot of bands though."
"__MUSIC__ Who else?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Guided by Voices?"
"__MUSIC__ I think so. They're a nineties band?"
"__MUSIC__ Started at the end of the eighties and still making music today. Incredibly prolific indie rock group."
"__MUSIC__ That rings a bell."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, well, I talk to a lot of music nerds and over the years I've gotten a ton of flack for not liking them."
"__MUSIC__ People saying like 'how do you not like them?'"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. The Flaming Lips too, there's something too campy about them for me."
"__MUSIC__ I love the Flaming Lips, but I get your point."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you for not ripping my head off!"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! It's your taste, not mine, good for me, not for you!"
