"__DISNEY__ Do you have a favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ When I was younger it was the Little Mermaid but now I really like Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ It's always been The Lion King for me. I watched it over and over when I was little."
"__DISNEY__ That's definitely one of the best that's ever been made. But I love the Disney Princesses."
"__DISNEY__ Nala is not enough of a princess for you?"
"__DISNEY__ You know what I mean, she's not considered a princess like Ariel or Belle."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I know. I'm sure we can at least agree that we miss hand drawn Disney?"
"__DISNEY__ Absolutely. Those were the good old days."
"__DISNEY__ Wait, I forgot about the amazingness of Frozen and Moana."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yeah. Okay it's all great."
