"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see the match between the Houston Rockets and the San Antonio Spurs last night?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah! The last 15 seconds in overtime was the best!"
"__BASKETBALL__ They were trailing by three and put the ball in James Harden's hands thinking he was going to make the shot."
"__BASKETBALL__ They've been using that gameplay all year."
"__BASKETBALL__ But it didn't work this time. Manu Ginobili blocked him from behind."
"__BASKETBALL__ That was the play of the night!"
"__BASKETBALL__ That's probably the last big moment of his career though."
"__BASKETBALL__ What makes you say that?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, he's already 39 and he's been looking old this postseason."
"__BASKETBALL__ I guess your right, but I must say, crafty plays is what he's done best over his 15 year career."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I agree. And he finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and five assists."
"__BASKETBALL__ True. The Spurs needed all of his performance, especially in overtime."
"__BASKETBALL__ You can say that again!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Did you see what happened to Kawhi Leonard?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I saw him sitting on the bench but I didn't know why."
"__BASKETBALL__ He hurt his ankle early in the game and never returned."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh. I didn't know because I missed the first 30 minutes."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh. Harden played a great game this time."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah! He recorded a triple-double with 33 points!"
"__BASKETBALL__ Do you know when the next match is?"
