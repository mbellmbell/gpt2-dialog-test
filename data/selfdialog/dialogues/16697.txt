"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good German films? We're doing a German movie night for the cultural club."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. I might have seen a few. Not lately though."
"__MOVIES__ Were there any you liked? I don't think they need to be recent."
"__MOVIES__ I remember really liking The White Ribbon."
"__MOVIES__ What's that about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's set in a German village in 1913. It's a little dark though."
"__MOVIES__ Too much for a cultural club?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe."
"__MOVIES__ Well, there was one option that was funny. Maybe you could watch it and tell me if you think it's appropriate."
"__MOVIES__ Sure, what is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie called 'He's Back.'"
"__MOVIES__ What's the premise?"
"__MOVIES__ Hitler magically returns to Germany in 2010. But everyone thinks he's a method actor doing an impersonation."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like it could be really funny, but maybe a little off for a cultural movie night."
"__MOVIES__ Well. I had one other idea."
"__MOVIES__ What is it?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie called 'The Lives of Others.' It's not funny, but it's not inappropriate either."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a good film?"
"__MOVIES__ I found it very moving."
"__MOVIES__ Then I think you should go with that!"
