"__MUSIC__ So do you like Elton John."

"__MUSIC__ Plus he's a great piano man.  He puts on a pretty good show."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I would have liked to see him and Billy Joel go out together."
"__MUSIC__ Easily the best two piano men of our time."
"__MUSIC__ They are both just tops."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if they'll ever go out again?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe, hey you know what was a good Elton John son?  Tiny dancer."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that was really good."
"__MUSIC__ He just has one of the best voices you could ever hear."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they don't make them like that anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Him and Billy Joel were kind of like the fathers of today's alternative."
