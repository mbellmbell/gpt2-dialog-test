"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Just whatever the kids are watching!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Tell me about it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Some of the new kids movies are actually pretty cute though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, until you've seen them 500 times!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Agreed. My daughter won't stop watching Moana, so I can't say that's one I enjoy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That's how my daughter was with Frozen, until Moana came out!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I still think Frozen is a cute movie."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I do too."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ It's good to have a Disney movie without a prince charming kind of person."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'm all about teaching my daughter girl power!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Are your kids watching Over the Hedge?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes! That's my favorite. It's so cute."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Totally. The animal movies totally get me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too. I loved Ice Age when it came out ages ago!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, animated movies were different before we had kids!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Agreed! Happy Feet was another one I loved."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Me too. But now my world is Moana."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh, I can recite all the lines from that movie!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wanna get our daughters together for a playdate?"
