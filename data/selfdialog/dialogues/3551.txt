"__MUSIC__ where do you usually get your music albums? i need  Nelly's new album"
"__MUSIC__ the 'LIT'   music shop at 5th avenue,though i'm not certain if Nelly's album is in stock."
"__MUSIC__ oh that's too far,i can't find it in any near by music  shop."
"__MUSIC__ why this sudden urge for the album lol?"
"__MUSIC__ i heard one song off the album and i really loved the song,also seen some reviews about the album and its been positive ones."
"__MUSIC__ hmm i see,i haven't heard any recent work from Nelly of late talk less of  an album."
"__MUSIC__ you should listen to 'dream' mate, the song is so cool."
"__MUSIC__ coming from you i would have to check it out, i know you have a good ear for music."
"__MUSIC__ the lyrics of the song seems he was relating it to Ashanti."
"__MUSIC__ oh really? i thought they've finally broke up."
"__MUSIC__ yes they have, but you could sense from the song he was referring to her, even the video vixen used looks so much like her."
"__MUSIC__ so was he being insulting?"
"__MUSIC__ on the contrary no, its a story of someone who feels regrets for his actions."
"__MUSIC__ hmm well i feel he should rather get that behind him and focus more on putting his career back on track."
"__MUSIC__ come on, nelly is still relevant in the music industry, he's already a brand."
"__MUSIC__ let's face the fact, when last did Nelly drop a hit song that made it to top 10 of the billboard chart?"
"__MUSIC__ you can't quantify an artist success  through some billboard ratings."
"__MUSIC__ yes i know but it is an almost perfect reflection of who's hot and not, so if Nelly can't even make top 50 it tells a whole lot about his relevance."
"__MUSIC__ well lets see with 'dream' so far reviews are positive and might make top 10 on billboard,cos the song really sound great."
"__MUSIC__ well lets hope so, i am still a fan,he just have to make some good music like he used to before,like the 'ride with me' days lol."
