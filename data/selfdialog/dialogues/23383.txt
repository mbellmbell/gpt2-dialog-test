"__DISNEY__ They need to remaster One Hundred and One Dalmatians."
"__DISNEY__ No they don't. It's a classic."
"__DISNEY__ I know, but the animation is so dated."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't it release in the '60s? There are older more dated Disney films than that."
"__DISNEY__ You mean like Alice in Wonderland?"
"__DISNEY__ Sure, Alice in Wonderland. Also Bambi, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, and Pinocchio."
"__DISNEY__ You're right. They should remake them all."
"__DISNEY__ Why would you want to remake all those classics?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't really enjoy the dated animations. I just want them to look more modern."
"__DISNEY__ To each their own, I guess. But you're wrong."
