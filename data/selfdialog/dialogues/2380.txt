"__MUSIC__ Were you ever a Kiss fan?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I like the visuals."
"__MUSIC__ Heard their music much?"
"__MUSIC__ No, come to think of it. Just 2 or 3 hits."
"__MUSIC__ I hear you. I was deceived into thinking they were all flash and no musical substance."
"__MUSIC__ How so? Hmm."
"__MUSIC__ My brother gave me the impression they just had cool makeup but were generic rock n' roll."
"__MUSIC__ That turned out not to be true?"
"__MUSIC__ Not at all. Even the early stuff has some cool melodic bass and pop elements that set them apart."
"__MUSIC__ So, it's not just blues rock or typical hard rock of the era?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely not. It's more like if you combined some earlier rock n' roll elements with a more melodic approach, plus hard rock of the '70s."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. Didn't expect that of them."
"__MUSIC__ Gene Simmons is a huge Paul McCartney fan, and a lot of his influence comes through in the bass lines."
"__MUSIC__ That's really weird when combined with that 'demon' makeup."
"__MUSIC__ For sure. I almost haven't fully registered it myself!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Didn't they do Hard Luck Woman?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and crazily enough, that was originally intended for Rod Stewart."
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Sounds like it, too."
"__MUSIC__ Another nutty fact: Peter Criss studied under Gene Krupa of all people."
"__MUSIC__ Well, this certainly sounds like a new discovery. That's even less expected if anything."
