"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Studio Ghibli movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely Castle In the Sky. How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen that. I'd have to say either Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro."
"__MOVIES__ Spirited Away was amazing, but I think I might have been too young when I first saw it. Yubaba wa terrifying."
"__MOVIES__ Nah, probably not. Yubaba still terrifies me."
"__MOVIES__ Hahaha. I love the animation, though."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, all of it, the people, the food, the spirits, even the water in the bathhouse."
"__MOVIES__ Oh my God, that food made me want to eat it. I didn't even know what half of it was, but it made me hungry."
"__MOVIES__ I think that was the point. It was supposed to look really tasty."
"__MOVIES__ It did."
"__MOVIES__ It was the pigs that scared me. That part freaked me out."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too. It was really well done."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the soot sprites."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, they were so cute. Did you like No Face?"
"__MOVIES__ At first he scared me, but I did later."
"__MOVIES__ Same. I felt the same way about Haku."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me too. It was hard to tell at first who was an enemy and who wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was supposed to be like that."
"__MOVIES__ Now I want to watch it again."
"__MOVIES__ We should have a Studio Ghibli marathon day. My sister has Spirited Away, Totoro, Castle in The Sky, Princess Mononoke, and Kiki's Delivery Service on blue ray."
