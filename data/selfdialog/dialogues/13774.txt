"__BASKETBALL__ The Western Conference Finals is finally set."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  The Spurs and the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ It feels like this is the matchup everyone has been waiting for this entire season."
"__BASKETBALL__ It sure feels that way. Who do you think will win?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, I think you have to go with the Warriors.  I mean they haven't lost a single game in the playoffs yet."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is amazing.  I too think the Warriors are the favorite."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't think you can ever write off the Spurs though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well yea.  Parker goes out for the season, Kawhi gets hurt, and yet the beat the Rockets."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  It seemed like everyone wrote off the Spurs, and then all of a sudden they destroyed the Rockets."
"__BASKETBALL__ That Game 6 performance shows what the Spurs are capable of if they are firing on all cylinders."
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed, and they did that without Kawhi, their best player."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think they have to play a similar way against the Warriors."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, you are right.  You can't match small on small with the Warriors or try to shoot 3s with them."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, nobody can beat the Warriors playing that way.  Well maybe except the Cavaliers."
"__BASKETBALL__ But the Spurs don't have that kind of firepower.  I think they need to stay big and try to play inside."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree.  They need huge games from Aldridge and Gasol."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes.  That margin for error is super thin.  I don't think those big guys can even have one game where they play poorly."
"__BASKETBALL__ You are right.  If the Spurs pull of the upset, it will probably take 7 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ And they are going to need Gasol and Aldridge to play well in all 7 games."
"__BASKETBALL__ And of course, they need Kawhi back healthy and playing at a high level."
