"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was so happy when Ludacris showed back up in the Fast5."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Tej is definitely welcome at my house anytime."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well when he's gonna show up with nice cars, hot women, and gets you paid; why wouldn't he be?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I like him a lot better after he lost the afro and sweats though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Agreed, it certainly upped his cool factor."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ My favorite scene was in the 7th movie I think, when he was talking to Rome and Rome was telling him how rare his car was."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Then Tej walked outside and he had the same exact one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, I busted out laughing at that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was classic, but for me, his best scene was his first appearance. After the race when Brian gives him some of the winnings and he turns to show it off to the crowd."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ And thus the legend was born."
