"__MUSIC__ Do you like rap music?"
"__MUSIC__ It depends on the artist and the content."
"__MUSIC__ Which artists do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I have a wide range of artists within the rap world that I listen to.  From Will Smith's bubblegum rap to DMX or TuPac."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like Snoop Dog?"
"__MUSIC__ I enjoy several of his songs but I think he works best on collaborations with other artists."
"__MUSIC__ For example?"
"__MUSIC__ 'The Next Episode' was a song he worked on with Dr. Dre.  It's got a really nice hook and flow."
"__MUSIC__ What do people mean when they refer to flow in the genre of rap?"
"__MUSIC__ In my opinion, they're talking about the way the words and music flow with each other- it's like a groove, when you're in it, you're in it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you ever get offended by the lyrics? Hasn't there been controversy with rap lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ I've only heard one or two songs, in my life, with lyrics that were so offensive I couldn't listen.  And, there's controversy in any genre."
"__MUSIC__ How do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Rap doesn't have a trademark on controversy.  In the 80's, rap was a way for a minority population to express the feelings they had about authority."
"__MUSIC__ Sure."
"__MUSIC__ So, if something or someone is making you angry, the rap would reflect that anger.  But, I don't think it was a physical battle cry.  I think it was meant to be a statement on a situation."
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean a racial situation?"
"__MUSIC__ Could be racial, but it was more often than not a societal commentary.  And, it's not solely a rap thing."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you're right.  Didn't the Dixie Chicks get  in hot water for some of their lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ Not only them, but Toby Keith, and several country artists have made political and cultural statements with their work."
