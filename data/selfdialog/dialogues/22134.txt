"__DISNEY__ Did you know that Disney was inspired by Shakespeare?"
"__DISNEY__ What? I thought they took inspiration from like fairytales and stuff."
"__DISNEY__ Well, that too, but some people say The Lion King is basically just Hamlet with lions."
"__DISNEY__ I guess that makes sense, with the whole father dying angle and such."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, and then Simba has to eventually slay his uncle--who is maybe married to his mother now?"
"__DISNEY__ I think Simba has a happier ending than Hamlet does, though."
"__DISNEY__ That's certainly true, he doesn't wind up dying for one!"
"__DISNEY__ And he gets to sing better songs and hook up with Nala in the end."
"__DISNEY__ I shipped Nala and Simba so hard as a kid."
"__DISNEY__ Well, Nala was surprisingly cute for an animated lion!"
