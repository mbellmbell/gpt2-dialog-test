"__MOVIES__ Do you remember Lake Placid?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really.  What was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a kind of a nature horror movie."
"__MOVIES__ What does that even mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it was about a mutant animal living in this lake."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds kind of common and boring."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it wasn't that bad.  It was kind of like Jaws set in a lake."
"__MOVIES__ So there was a shark in the lake?"
"__MOVIES__ No, it actually turned out to be an overfed crocodile!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wait, did it have Betty White in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she owned the land by the lake."
"__MOVIES__ Wasn't she the one feeding the croc?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, wasn't she hilarious?"
"__MOVIES__ Betty White is awesome and I loved this part!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, anyway she had fed the cows to the croc."
"__MOVIES__ It was like a pet to her right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she wanted to protect it too."
"__MOVIES__ Hadn't the crocodile eaten her husband?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and as bad as it was, I laughed at that part too!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too!  It was the best!"
