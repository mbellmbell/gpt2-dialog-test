"__HARRY_POTTER__ Harry, duh...."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really mine is Snape."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh you got to be kidding. Why Snape?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because he is the ultimate conflicted character. He's bad and good."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ No he's not. He just a jerk that has issues. And he cause the death of Harry's parents."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I suppose you would see it that way, but he did make up for past mistakes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You think? Tell that to Harry...growing with the Dursley's and always having Voldemort trying to kill him. At least Voldemort let him finish school each year."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it was good of him. That's what make Snape great, he didn't buy in to the Harry worship."
