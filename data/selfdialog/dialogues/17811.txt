"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the recent Guardians of the Galaxy movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't yet. Have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I saw it just the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It was pretty good. I thought the plot was a little weaker but the characters better."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the first one seemed like it was more exciting, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ That's different. Usually the first ones are more boring because they're setting up the universe."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's what I would have thought too, but not this time."
"__MOVIES__ But the characters were cool, then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I really loved the bad guys, the Sovereign."
"__MOVIES__ Are those the gold people? I saw them online."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're the gold guys. They're really funny and cool."
"__MOVIES__ They didn't look very funny from the clips I've seen."
"__MOVIES__ They are! They have these like video game ships that are awesome and their reactions are hilarious."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds pretty sweet then. I'll have to go see the movie."
"__MOVIES__ You should, it was great. The plot was pretty funny too, even if it wasn't as exciting as the first."
"__MOVIES__ How was the soundtrack?"
"__MOVIES__ The soundtrack was awesome as usual."
"__MOVIES__ That's good. I'll go see it then."
