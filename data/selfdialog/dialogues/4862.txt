"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard a Shakira song in a long time."
"__MUSIC__ Me either."
"__MUSIC__ Her song Hips Don't Lie was such a big hit."
"__MUSIC__ I know, and around the time it released her song with Beyonce came out."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. What was it called again?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was called Beautiful Liar."
"__MUSIC__ That's right. I used to love that song."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I'll have to check out some of Shakira's newer music."
"__MUSIC__ The last I knew she voiced a character in Zootopia."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Unsurprisingly she played a singer."
"__MUSIC__ That's funny, but now that I'm thinking about it.. didn't she sing a song for the Olympics pretty recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you might be right."
"__MUSIC__ I know she received a lot of attention for her song for the 2010 World Cup."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah. I forgot about her song Waka Waka."
"__MUSIC__ She has such a unique voice."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. She doesn't sound like anybody else."
"__MUSIC__ She kind of looks like how Mariah Carey looked in the beginning of her career."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I think it's the wavy hair."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, and now Mariah Carey's style is straight hair."
