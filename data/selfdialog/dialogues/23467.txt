"__DISNEY__ Cars 3? Yes, there are three Cars movies."
"__DISNEY__ Wait, what was Cars 2 about again?"
"__DISNEY__ The first one happened with Sally at Radiator Springs and the second was the spy one."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, yah, I remember now.  Didn't Mater eat wasabi thinking it was ice cream?"
"__DISNEY__ Yah, that was the one."
"__DISNEY__ So, what is Cars 3 about?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen it, yet. I saw some previews with what I thought was an electric car."
"__DISNEY__ That would be crazy, if Flash raced an electric car."
"__DISNEY__ It would.  I don't think Lasseter did the storyline, though"
"__DISNEY__ I like Lasseter films.  If someone else directed it, I doubt Flash would win his big race.  Have you ever ridden in a Tesla?"
