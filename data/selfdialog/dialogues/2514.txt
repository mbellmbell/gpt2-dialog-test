"__MUSIC__ You were in band, orchestra, jazz, and all that in high school, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yup, concert band, marching band, jazz band, pep band, orchestra, choir,"
"__MUSIC__ Okay, Mr. Showoff, I get it. Did you have a favorite moment that led you to pursuing it in college?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I had learned trumpet but was getting bored after 8 years. So I took on tuba."
"__MUSIC__ Tuba is not normally how things begin."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, well, I learned it by myself. And got really good at it."
"__MUSIC__ How good is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Within a year or so of learning it, I made lead in county band, second in district band, and fourth in the region band."
"__MUSIC__ So you were one of the top tubists in the state?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, after just a year or so of learning, without lessons."
"__MUSIC__ I wish I had kept going."
"__MUSIC__ What did you play?"
"__MUSIC__ I was an oboist!"
"__MUSIC__ I love the oboe! Did you ever try out the English Horn?"
"__MUSIC__ I wanted to, but it never came up in our band or orchestra. We didn't have a horn."
"__MUSIC__ You know the English Horn is neither English nor a horn, right?"
"__MUSIC__ You know the tuba is neither a two nor a buh, right?"
"__MUSIC__ That made no sense."
"__MUSIC__ Well, neither did your joke."
"__MUSIC__ It wasn't a joke. It's just one of the many instruments given improper names."
