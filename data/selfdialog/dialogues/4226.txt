"__MUSIC__ Do you know my greatest disappointment in technology in my life was the first time I heard a CD?"
"__MUSIC__ What? Why? There's the full range of frequency with digital."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, and no tape hiss or the 'snap, crackle and pop' like we had with records."
"__MUSIC__ Then why were you disappointed?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the music did NOT 'tickle my ears' like I used to get listening to records with a good set of head phones."
"__MUSIC__ What was the first digital recording you ever heard?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it was a CD of 'Beethoven's 9th Symphony', and it really didn't sound as good as I had expected."
"__MUSIC__ I remember being a kid in school in 1972 when they showed us a 'Scientific American' article or something, about the 'music player of the future'."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I remember. The promise of lasers playing music, no needles on the record, no more tape hiss!"
"__MUSIC__ Then again, have you considered that maybe the years of listening to loud records with headphones damaged your ears a certain way?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ I remember getting a tiny magazine in the mail dealing with tape enthusiasts, had an interview with Pete Townshend."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, the guitarist with the Who? He's done great interviews about all the old equipment, the tube-powered stuff, right off the top of his head."
"__MUSIC__ Right. And maybe your complaint about digital music sounding 'dead' and 'sterile' explains why records and tube amps came back again!"
"__MUSIC__ And I seem to remember a Peter Townshend interview where he mentions musicians being deaf in only SOME frequencies."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, from cranking the amps really loud while playing live, in front of the 'stacks' of speakers. I think he was with a charity dealing with hearing loss."
"__MUSIC__ My gosh, listen to the opening of 'Hush' by Deep Purple. You can HEAR the amp hiss BEFORE they start actually playing."
"__MUSIC__ Probably stuck a microphone in front of a speaker to create a 'live' sound for some of the instruments, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ So maybe a new generation born after 1987 or so, who never listened to records with headphones, have different ears than me?"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I've been thinking lately. The process of listening to music changes our ability to hear the music?"
