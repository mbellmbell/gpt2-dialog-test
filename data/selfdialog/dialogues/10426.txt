"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I heard Remy Ma dissed Nicki Minaj."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ She did, on a track called Sheether."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is that a sly reference to Ether?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It is, but I wouldn't say it's as clever."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What's it like?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well, it's really bald and the lyrics are blunt. She was not playing around."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It seems everybody is coming for Nicki these days."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well when you get that high on the charts, somebody is gonna gun for your spot."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's true. Same thing happened to Lil' Kim."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ And even she has come for Nicki!"
