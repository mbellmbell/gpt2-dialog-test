"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I watched Fast Five for the first time last night."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What did you think of it?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I actually quite enjoyed it, I had never seen past the third one."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you watch the fourth as well?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, I heard it gets better around the fifth."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, the franchise turns into an action movie instead of mainly about racing."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, that is exactly how I felt."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The sixth one is a lot like that too."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That was pretty smart of them to spin off the genre."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, the movies have been getting pretty good compared to the originals."
