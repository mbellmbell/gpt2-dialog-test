"__DISNEY__ Did you ever see Findiny Dory?"
"__DISNEY__ No not yet, I heard it's really good though."
"__DISNEY__ Yea I thought so. Probably not as good as Finding Nemo, but still good."
"__DISNEY__ Well Finding Nemo was an instant classic, so it would be pretty hard to top the original."
"__DISNEY__ That's true."
"__DISNEY__ Is there going to be another sequel after Finding Dory?"
"__DISNEY__ I can't tell you, that's spoil the end of Finding Dory for you if you ever decided to see it."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, ok, fair enough."
"__DISNEY__ Definitely give it a watch though. You can never go wrong with Ellen Degeneres voicing a fish."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, yea I'll make sure I watch it soon."
