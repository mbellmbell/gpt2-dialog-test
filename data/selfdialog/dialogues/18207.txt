"__MOVIES__ hi danny, you've seen reviews for tom cruise 'the mummy' franchised."
"__MOVIES__ oh not really but i heard on E news that its not doing well in box office."
"__MOVIES__ i am telling you, i wanted to rent on netflix but the reviews are so bad."
"__MOVIES__ one would have expected that Tom Cruse starring on the already popular ''the mummy' series it would be an instant box office hit."
"__MOVIES__ i had thought so myself, he was the reason i wanted to watch."
"__MOVIES__ one thing i have to say though is that sometimes this reviews are of individual opinion you might just watch the movie and be like Okay so why the bad reviews."
"__MOVIES__ lol oh that's true, happened so many times, good example was 'now you see me'"
"__MOVIES__ oyeah 'now you see me' got so many bad reviews."
"__MOVIES__ aside the bad reviews the jacket art made it look like an amatuer movie even with morgan freeman starring."
"__MOVIES__ it also had the guy that acted on 'social network'"
"__MOVIES__ yeah jesse eisenberg."
"__MOVIES__ yes that's his name."
"__MOVIES__ true, when i saw the preview and album art i just scroll past it anytime i am searching for movie to watch"
"__MOVIES__ i did that couple of times as well until one say i exhausted all new movies and was like let me just waste time with it, but boy it was the most intriguing movie i ever watched that whole year."
"__MOVIES__ same i was shocked with what was packed in it, movie was so engaging, and i still rate it on my top 5 list."
"__MOVIES__ you see, so since then i don't really lay much emphasis on reviews, i just set aside a day to watch it , especially a movie like 'the mummy' with cruise on it."
"__MOVIES__ i might as well just rent and watch it though, it can't be that bad."
"__MOVIES__ i bet."
"__MOVIES__ anyways i will tell you my take when i watch myself."
"__MOVIES__ oyeah no worries mate, talk later."
