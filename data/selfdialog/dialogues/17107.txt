"__MOVIES__ Hey have you seen the new Jack Reacher movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Are you talking about never go back?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that's the one! I thought it was an awesome movie an it has me anxious for the third installment!"
"__MOVIES__ Are they doing a third one for sure?"
"__MOVIES__ Not sure just yet, nothing official has been announced yet. I guess i am just hoping!"
"__MOVIES__ I seen the second one and thought it was pretty good. Although it is probably not one that I would want to watch again."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought it is was even better than the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Not to me, the first one was one of my all time favorites. I cant really say that about the sequel."
"__MOVIES__ I am that way about most sequels, but this one was an exception for me."
"__MOVIES__ I just wished they would have put more action scenes throughout the movie."
"__MOVIES__ There was enough action for me, I enjoy movies where they build up the mystery a little more."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I am hopeful they will make a part three."
"__MOVIES__ Would you really want to watch it since the sequel let you down?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yea, for sure. I am a big fan of the book series that led to the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, I didn't even realize that the jack reacher movies were based on books. I feel silly now!"
"__MOVIES__ I am sure a lot of people are the same way. They are from Author Lee Child, and each movie gets its story based off of one of the books."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, how closely do the plots from the books align with the actual movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Very similar, although they did not go in order in terms of which book came next in terms of the sequel."
"__MOVIES__ Well if they do come out with a third installment we will defenitley have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ No doubt! I look forward to checking out Tom Cruise return as Jack Reacher!"
