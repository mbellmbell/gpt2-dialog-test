"__STAR_WARS__ Disney has been doing a great job on making movies these days, especially the Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. The Force Awakens was a surprise to me in how good it was. I think Disney was wise to hire JJ. Abrams to direct the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think with a foundation as huge as Star Wars and 245 Million budget, JJ. Abrams could not go wrong."
"__STAR_WARS__ Correct. Do you think that the Last Jedi will be as great?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I plan on it being so. I'm really hoping that Luky Skywalker plays more of a part in the Last Jedi then the little bits and pieces he had in the Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would think we will see more of Mark Hamill, because I believe his character Luke is the Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ What about Carrie Fischer and her Leia character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ God rest her soul, but I am hoping to see JJ. Abrams and Disney incorporate Princess Leia into the Last Jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think many of her fans are hoping and praying for that as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ We can only wait and see what the future holds in store for The Last Jedi."
