"__MUSIC__ Oh my God, it's October and they're playing CHRISTMAS MUSIC already."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, um, would be nice if they could wait until after Halloween if they can't wait until after Thanksgiving."
"__MUSIC__ Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Christmas music, all kinds, but it is to create a certain seasonal spirit and overkill kills the vibe."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I don't love it really. I like a few songs from childhood, but mostly it gets on my nerves."
"__MUSIC__ Yes but that's because you focus on the commercialism, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. Every commercial, every store, whole radio stations that change format for two months. Blech."
"__MUSIC__ My great memories stretch back to the 60s when I was a kid. My gram liked us to sing all the old churchy ones."
"__MUSIC__ What are the church ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Hark the Herald, We Three Kings, Little Town of Bethlehem, Joy to the World etc."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I like those!"
"__MUSIC__ See? I'm not saying I don't love Mariah and few other modern ones, but I don't wanna hear the Back Street Boys reunite for Jingle Bells."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha yes and nobody needs Grandma to get run over by a reindeer or mommy to be kissing Santa Clause."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. All that stuff is sooo gooofy and has nothing to do with my Christmas joy."
"__MUSIC__ Can you still sing the churchy ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Gram was clever enough to leave us her stack of little blue song books she would pass out to us every Christmas."
"__MUSIC__ Wow so it's tradition for you for real! Did you guys go caroling hahaha?"
"__MUSIC__ Don't laugh - I actually did go caroling when I was a kid, but not with my family - neighbor friends."
"__MUSIC__ Is that like going wassailing? hahahaa"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so. As far as I know, 'wassail' is some sort of homemade alcoholic drink made of spices and honey."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha that would be a very Dean Martin Christmas."
