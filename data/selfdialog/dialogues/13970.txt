"__BASKETBALL__ Is Markelle Fultz that much better than everyone?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm not sure Lonzo Ball seems pretty good too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I just don't know much about those top guys."
"__BASKETBALL__ I know Lonzo Ball has a crazy dad."
"__BASKETBALL__ He sure has that. What is with that guy?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't know man. He's a little too confident in his kid."
"__BASKETBALL__ Just a little bit. Its ridiculous."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, I agree. I feel bad for the kid."
"__BASKETBALL__ I don't. He's about to get paid."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, he is in a big way, but I don't know if he will live up to it."
"__BASKETBALL__ We'll you never know with these guys. You just cant."
"__BASKETBALL__ That is true. Its all a gamble."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, thats why its called a draft."
"__BASKETBALL__ I agree. Hopefully the top 3 at least are gamers."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, we will find out in about a month."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, about that. I just hope the sixers get a good player."
"__BASKETBALL__ They should at number 3."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, no Fultz, but thats okay."
"__BASKETBALL__ Seems like the top ten is pretty good."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yea, but usually a few don't pan out."
