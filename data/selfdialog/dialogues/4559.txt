"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Insane Clown Posse?"
"__MUSIC__ No way, I think that is garbage!"
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?  They're hilarious!"
"__MUSIC__ They're disgusting, them and that band Twiztid if you could even call it a band."
"__MUSIC__ I've been listening to them for years.  It's supposed to be funny, not offensive."
"__MUSIC__ Well, to me it's offensive.  I've never heard of Twiztid but if they're anything like ICP I don't want to hear them."
"__MUSIC__ You're being too uptight.  You're taking it too seriously."
"__MUSIC__ It is serious!  I'd much prefer listen to something low key and mellow."
"__MUSIC__ Their music hypes me up!"
"__MUSIC__ That's just the thing.  I like to be calm."
"__MUSIC__ Well, then I guess they're not a good fit for you.  What are you listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly country and some oldies.  Stuff that's very different from what you're listening to."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I'd say.  What kind of oldies?"
"__MUSIC__ I like Al Green and Teddy Pendergrass, soul music like that."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that is some really old stuff.  I can't get down with it."
"__MUSIC__ Well, it calms me and makes me feel relaxed."
"__MUSIC__ I guess we have different motivations for listening to music."
"__MUSIC__ Totally.  I want to be wound down."
"__MUSIC__ I want to be wound up.  I like hip hop mostly."
"__MUSIC__ I can't stand it."
