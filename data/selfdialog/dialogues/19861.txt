"__MOVIES__ You know, I haven't like one of the X-men movies."
"__MOVIES__ You're kidding, I love them all, even the bad ones."
"__MOVIES__ They're all bad. Bryan Singer doesn't understand them."
"__MOVIES__ WOLVERINE, he's great."
"__MOVIES__ He did get him right and professor X.I love it when Wolverine pops his claws..."
"__MOVIES__ It's not about that, the story is wrong. Patrick Stewart is great as the professor and Hugh Jackson kills it as Wolverine so he didn't screw up everything."
"__MOVIES__ I dont watch X-men for the stoiry."
"__MOVIES__ That's the problem. If Singer would do good stories instead of messing up all the good stuff in the comics you would watch those movies for the story."
"__MOVIES__ There's stories in the movies."
"__MOVIES__ But they're not good ones. Days of Future Past is sort of like the Terminator in the comic books. They do a little bit of it in the movie."
"__MOVIES__ That does sound cool, the robots were great in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ YEAH, there should have been moire Sentinels and less 70s stuff."
"__MOVIES__ I see."
"__MOVIES__ In X-men 3 they did the Phoenix story and totally botched it up."
"__MOVIES__ I hear they're re-doing it."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it seems like they're going to do it more like the comics. The comics have great stories."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds good."
"__MOVIES__ It's the reason why Marvel movies dont suck. They pay attention to the comic books."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the X-men were Marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ They are more like distant cousins. Fox owns the X-men not Msrvel."
