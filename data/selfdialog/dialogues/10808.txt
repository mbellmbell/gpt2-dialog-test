"__FASHION__ What were some of your favorite looks at the Met gala this year?"
"__FASHION__ I loved Rhianna's dress, she really followed the theme this year."
"__FASHION__ Oh, that's right, the theme was about the fashion of Comme des Garçons."
"__FASHION__ Caroline Kennedy wore Comme des Garçons and looked amazing."
"__FASHION__ I thought Madonna looked interesting, I think Jeremy Scott designed her dress."
"__FASHION__ I remember her dress, it was a military theme, and she wore gloves."
"__FASHION__ Who else wore Comme des Garçons to the Met gala?"
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure, I think Anna Wintour actually wore Chanel."
"__FASHION__ Lena Dunham wore a really pretty dress to the gala."
"__FASHION__ I recall her outfit, it was really elegant and had a very long train."
"__FASHION__ The men didn't really stand out at the gala, fashion wise."
"__FASHION__ No, but Roger Federer wore a Gucci jacket that was interesting."
"__FASHION__ A lot of ladies wore gloves this year, maybe that's a new trend."
"__FASHION__ It could be, I like long gloves as an accessory to bring out the colors in an ensemble."
"__FASHION__ I'm not sure if I would have followed the theme either this year, Rei Karakubo's clothes are very eccentric."
"__FASHION__ Yes, her runway shows are far out, but her ready to wear is far more down to earth."
"__FASHION__ I just remembered that the girlfriend of someone famous wore a nice Comme des Garçons dress, it was oddly shaped."
"__FASHION__ I think odd shapes are a nice signature of Rei Karakubo's work for Comme des Garçons, it's hard to pull that off, but she does."
"__FASHION__ Shoes did not really seem to garner much attention at the gala this year."
"__FASHION__ No, but I saw a rapper wearing Louboutins, I didn't know they made those for men!"
