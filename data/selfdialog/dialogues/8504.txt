"__BEATLES__ Do you like the earlier Beatles' music or the latter?"
"__BEATLES__ Do you mean the songs they did before Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, do you prefer their style of music like they played on Ed Sullivan or the more lyrical music?"
"__BEATLES__ I actually prefer some of the music from Rubber Soul, especially Norwegian Wood."
"__BEATLES__ Rubber Soul paved the way for Sgt. Pepper's, I think, and had a mix of the old sound with the new."
"__BEATLES__ You're right about that. Drive My Car sounded like it could have been on the Help album."
"__BEATLES__ Yes, but I think their later music was influenced by their trip to India."
"__BEATLES__ Absolutely! Dear Prudence on the White Album was directly inspired by their experience there."
"__BEATLES__ They had a wide-ranging, ground-breaking sound."
"__BEATLES__ They certainly did. And their many innovations can be heard in more modern groups, like 1990's band Oasis."
