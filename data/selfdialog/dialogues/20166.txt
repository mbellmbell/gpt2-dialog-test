"__MOVIES__ What's the scariest movie you ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably the Exorcist."
"__MOVIES__ Yes that was pure horror at its best."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, plus good acting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, everyone gives Linda Blair the credit but she didn't do the voice."
"__MOVIES__ It was all Mercedes MCabridge."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, no one remembers her but we all remember Linda Blair."
"__MOVIES__ Almost like the opposite of the movie where everyone remembers her as Satan and not Regan."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting point."
"__MOVIES__ She does deserve credit for what she did with her body."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that was what was so horrifying."
"__MOVIES__ And that makeup was creepy."
"__MOVIES__ Still gives me chills to this day."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they never remake that.  Make as many sequels and copy cats as you want but leave classics to be."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, horror genius."
"__MOVIES__ It's in everyone's top scariest list."
"__MOVIES__ I can't wait for October.  I love going on a horror binge."
"__MOVIES__ I start in September.  Just to get ready for October."
"__MOVIES__ I see, so you can get the classics out of the way and then go digging for new ones."
"__MOVIES__ Never fails.  Every year I find a hidden gem or two."
