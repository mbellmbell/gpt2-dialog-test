"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the sequel to Alice in Wonderland?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I have watched Alice Through the Looking Glass. I'm a huge fan."
"__MOVIES__ I also love Tim Burton's work. It's so imaginative and ethereal. Though he only produced this one."
"__MOVIES__ This one was a bit sad too as it was Alan Rickman's last film."
"__MOVIES__ That is sad. Did he get to watch it before he died?"
"__MOVIES__ No, he passed away four months prior to the film's release."
"__MOVIES__ I'm guessing he was the voice of Absolem again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that's right. The movie is dedicated to him."
"__MOVIES__ I do know that this film marks the ninth time Tim Burton has collaborated with Johnny Depp."
"__MOVIES__ That is a lot! I guess it must be because they both have a good rapport and understanding."
"__MOVIES__ Which is your favorite character in Through The Looking Glass?"
"__MOVIES__ I would have to say the character of Time. I thought he was very unique and original."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I liked him too. I thought he was a very endearing character."
"__MOVIES__ I'm surprised this movie didn't do as well in the box office."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I remember hearing about that. It surprised me too."
"__MOVIES__ The opening gross at the U.S. box-office was 77 percent less."
"__MOVIES__ That's a lot. I wonder why so many people didn't go to watch it?"
"__MOVIES__ A good question. I'm not sure. I just know that I loved it."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think there will be a third film?"
"__MOVIES__ I hope so. I think a trilogy would be great!"
