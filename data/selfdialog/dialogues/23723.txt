"__DISNEY__ What did you think of the new Beauty and the Beast movie with Emma Watson?"
"__DISNEY__ To be honest, I didn't really care for it."
"__DISNEY__ Really? Why not?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Belle is supposed to be the most beautiful girl in the entire village."
"__DISNEY__ Okay.. And??"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I don't find Emma Watson to be all that beautiful."
"__DISNEY__ Why not? I think she's very pretty."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I don't think she's ugly. But there were tons of people throughout the movie that are more attractive than her."
"__DISNEY__ Well, she's a popular actress so that's probably why she was cast for the part. She's also a good actress on top of being well liked."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I suppose that's true. I was just disappointed, is all."
