"__MOVIES__ My boyfriend and I just watched the Dallas Buyers' Club the other night. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I've heard of it. Who is in it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, Didn't McConaughey win an Oscar for it?"
"__MOVIES__ He did! Although I liked Leto's performance better."
"__MOVIES__ What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a Texas man's-man who gets HIV when most of the people getting it were gay."
"__MOVIES__ How did he get it?"
"__MOVIES__ He got it through unprotected sex with a woman who did intravenous drugs."
"__MOVIES__ That's so scary!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, and unfortunately he lost many of his friends because they thought he was gay, and they would not accept him anymore."
"__MOVIES__ That's horrible. What did he do?"
"__MOVIES__ He finds out about drugs available in other countries and makes them available in Dallas."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that illegal?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! He gets into trouble with the police and the IRS."
"__MOVIES__ So he just becomes a businessman?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of, but he also befriends a lot of people in the gay community and really helps people out."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, is it based on a real story?"
"__MOVIES__ It is! The man was only supposed to live for 30 days but he ended up living for 7 more years."
"__MOVIES__ That's inspiring! I want to see it now."
