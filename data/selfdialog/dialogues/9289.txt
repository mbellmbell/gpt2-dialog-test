"__BASEBALL__ Ask some questions to a baseball guru!"
"__BASEBALL__ Avasail Garcia, buy or sell?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sell. High BABIP suggests it's good luck."
"__BASEBALL__ Should White Sox trade Robertson? What could they get?"
"__BASEBALL__ He'd be in demand, but I think the Sox would need to eat some money to get anything of real good value."
"__BASEBALL__ Freddie Freeman's injury bad or not big deal?"
"__BASEBALL__ Out for 10 weeks so that's not good. If he makes it through rehab without complications he should return to form."
"__BASEBALL__ When do you think major trades start happening?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'd guess first week of June, thereabouts."
"__BASEBALL__ Brewers for real or do they fall back to earth?"
"__BASEBALL__ Good one. That's still tough to tell, I'd guess they don't win the central but could still be in the WC mix."
"__BASEBALL__ Can the Angels make a run and win their division?"
"__BASEBALL__ Houston looks to be running away, so the Angels can battle around for Wildcard as well. I'd think Texas has a better shot, though."
"__BASEBALL__ You think the Rangers are still in it? I'm hearing people talk about the moving Darvish already."
"__BASEBALL__ People talk, but Beltre is coming back and they can easily hang around."
"__BASEBALL__ SO you don't think they move Darvish?"
"__BASEBALL__ Only if they drop out of contention for sure and I don't expect that to happen."
"__BASEBALL__ Doug Fister signed with the Angels can he get back into old form?"
"__BASEBALL__ Fister? I hardly knew her. Haven't seen him in a while so lets see him throw some minor league innings first."
"__BASEBALL__ LOL good point"
