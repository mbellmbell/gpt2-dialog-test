"__MUSIC__ I don't know what to listen to. It's summer and I want something new, but fun."
"__MUSIC__ After Laughter, Paramore's new album is pretty amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Paramore? I thought they were emo?"
"__MUSIC__ They were? But this new album is a little different, they were never too dark or depressing in the first place."
"__MUSIC__ I liked that song, The Only Exception."
"__MUSIC__ Then you should listen to this album, it's like that, but more updated."
"__MUSIC__ I'll check it out, what songs are the best?"
"__MUSIC__ Well there's Hard Times which everyone seems to like."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds cheerful."
"__MUSIC__ It actually makes me feel better when I'm down. Because it's talking about hard times but it's got a great beat so I start singing along and start to feel better."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool, but I don't know if I like songs like that."
"__MUSIC__ Then you could try, 26."
"__MUSIC__ That's a song?"
"__MUSIC__ It is, it's my favourite on this album. It's kind of soft and slow."
"__MUSIC__ Is this supposed to be more cheerful than Hard Times? Or is this another depressing song?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not as down as Hard Times, it's slow, but it's beautiful. It's about having hope not matter what, not giving up on your dreams."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds...upbeat. You really like the cheerful stuff, huh?"
"__MUSIC__ You know for someone who wants such happy music, you sure are negative."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think I need the happy music? It balances out my sparkling personality."
"__MUSIC__ You should probably just listen to Cake by the Ocean and Can't Stop the Feeling."
