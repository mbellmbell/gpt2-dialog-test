"__BASKETBALL__ Alright, real talk, is Lebron James the best of all time?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, Michael Jordan. His Airness is the best."
"__BASKETBALL__ How can you say that with how lebron is dominating the east for the past 7 seasons already and counting."
"__BASKETBALL__ Michael Jordan was doing that in the harder east."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you kidding me? Jordan had to it against one hard team and that was the Knicks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Are you kidding me? The Pacers were really good then."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're joking me. I can make the same arguement, the Pacers were really good now."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yes, both those two teams were very good teams that should have won a ring, but that's besides the point, Lebron plays in a weaker east."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Lebron does it all. He can pass, rebound and play defense. He also scores well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but Jordan was clutch. He shot 50% at end game situations. What does Lebron do ?"
"__BASKETBALL__ He sets his teammates up in good situations to succeed at the end of the game."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, but Jordan grabbed the ball and did everything. Everyone in the building knew it was going to him also."
"__BASKETBALL__ This is just proving Lebron is more unselfish, you're taking my point and helping it succeed."
"__BASKETBALL__ You're not getting it. Lebron shies away from pressure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Jordan is a generic gambler and a terrible human being."
"__BASKETBALL__ So we're going to go into their personal lives? Who cares, we're talking about basketball."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, it's true. Lebron is a better human being than Jordan."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh please, I dont want to continue this awful conversation."
"__BASKETBALL__ I won. Lebron is the best."
"__BASKETBALL__ Whatever man, Jordan was better at basketball."
