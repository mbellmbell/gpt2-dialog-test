"__MOVIES__ So you said you like comedies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah!"
"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Tommy Boy?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not yet, but I'm always hearing references to it."
"__MOVIES__ Well the whole thing is a vehicle for Chris Farley with David Spade playing the straight man."
"__MOVIES__ No, I know that much."
"__MOVIES__ First off, it actually has a plot."
"__MOVIES__ That's good to know, sometimes those screwball comedies are weak on plot."
"__MOVIES__ Tommy Callahan--the Chris Farley character--is a total screwup (he took 9 years to graduate college) but he has to go on a roadtrip with David Spade to save his familys company."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a fun setup."
"__MOVIES__ But there are so many humorous moments. In one scene, he puts on the David Spade character's tiny sportcoat."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the fat guy in a little coat scene?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ I've seen it on youtube."
"__MOVIES__ It's great, it plays with both the size difference between farley and spade and farley's inherent physical comedy."
"__MOVIES__ He was a comedic genius. It's a shame he died to soon."
"__MOVIES__ There are so many moments in that movie that are hilarious, it would take me as long as the movie to tell you all."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to see it."
"__MOVIES__ Come over some time, I have it on DVD."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good!"
