"__THRILLER__ So, can you recommend any good thriller movies?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, I really liked Shutter Island, have you seen that one?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I did!  I've read the book too!  I thought they did a great job translating it to screen."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, me too!  I thought DiCaprio gave a really good performance in it."
"__THRILLER__ And of course, Scorsese always bring a real unique vision to his work."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I heard a neat theory about the ending as well.  You know how they told DiCaprio's character that if this doesn't work they're going to have lobotomize him?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and he regresses right back to his delusional self and they take him away at the end?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah before he goes he says something like, 'Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?'"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, I remember that.  What did you hear about that?"
"__THRILLER__ Well, I think Leo's character DIDN'T relapse.  That he just couldn't live with the guilt of killing his wife, so he decided he'd rather get lobotomized than deal with that pain, and that's his way of letting the other guy know."
