"__HARRY_POTTER__ My husband and I finished all of the Harry Potter movies finally. Out of curiosity, who was your favorite character?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I have always been a traditional Harry fan myself. He is just such a dynamic character."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ True, he is. I guess he is probably a lot of people's favorite."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well who is your favorite?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You know, I would have to say my favorite was Draco Malfoy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What? I don't know anyone else who would say Draco Malfoy is their favorite."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Personally, I find him relateable. I do not think he is a bad person, just someone who wants to please his family."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I guess I never thought of Draco like that. He is just a kid who is stuck between what is right and what his family wants."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ However, as far as funny characters-Hermione!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ She is a hoot."
