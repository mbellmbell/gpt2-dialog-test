"__MOVIES__ I think the remake of Dawn of the Dead is better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ Whoa there you're stepping on the toes of holy ground there."
"__MOVIES__ I just think they captured the overall vibe of being stuck inside of the mall better."
"__MOVIES__ I can agree that the remake is a great movie but I'm not sure it's better than the original."
"__MOVIES__ It's one of Zack Snyder's best films."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but that's not that hard to do, the bar is set low."
"__MOVIES__ Oh come on, he isn't that bad."
"__MOVIES__ True, I actually thought The Watchmen was a really good adaptation."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, people are on his case because of Batman v. Superman but that was doomed no matter what."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah DC in general just don't have their stuff together when it comes to their cinematic universe."
"__MOVIES__ It's a stretch to try and capture the success is Marvel is having and it's just rushed and poorly executed."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah there's no firm vision for their cinematic universe."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly, Marvel has their hands all over their cinematic universe and there's a vision, a way forward."
"__MOVIES__ The way the Marvel Cinematic Universe has panned out really is somewhat of a miracle."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and the fact that each one is still making bank is impressive."
"__MOVIES__ People expected the super hero fatigue but we haven't seen a hint of it yet."
"__MOVIES__ That's because you can't get fatigued on fun movies, super hero or non super hero."
"__MOVIES__ I'm curious what Marvel's next move will be when they eventually conclude the arcs in the cinematic universe."
"__MOVIES__ If the money is still rolling in then I can see them going for awhile after with a second arc."
"__MOVIES__ That's true, guess we will see if the TV shows and the movies clash."
