"__DISNEY__ What was that movie that had the dinosaur in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Dinosaur?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, that was a Disney movie, but the other dinosaur movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I think you're thinking of The Good Dinosaur."
"__DISNEY__ Yep, that's the one.  It was quite good, don't you think?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it.  I wasn't expecting much, but enjoyed the story."
"__DISNEY__ I'm not sure why some dinosaurs had human eyes and others didn't."
"__DISNEY__ Guess they wanted to show a more human side of those creatures."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, was just a bit weird to see, that's all."
"__DISNEY__ The movie was still a good time though."
