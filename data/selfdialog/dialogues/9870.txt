"__COMEDY__ Hey there!  Have you seen any good movies lately?"
"__COMEDY__ Not really.  I haven't been paying attention to movies lately."
"__COMEDY__ Why is that?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, I'm a bit burnt out.  I get excited about new movies, and then they end up being terrible."
"__COMEDY__ I can understand that; what you need is to watch some classic movies.  I like comedies myself."
"__COMEDY__ I enjoy comedy movies.  What would you suggest?"
"__COMEDY__ Well, I know it's a bit lame now, but I've always enjoyed older Adam Sandler movies."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yeah!  Like Happy Gilmore?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, that's a great one!  He plays a golfer with natural skill, and destroys the PGA tour with his loud mouth and skills."
"__COMEDY__ That sounds like a good choice.  I'll give it a watch; thanks!"
