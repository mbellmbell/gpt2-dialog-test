"__FASHION__ What do you think of the trend towards bell bottoms?"
"__FASHION__ My mother said she used to wear them in the 70s and they were very comfortable."
"__FASHION__ Did she keep any of them?"
"__FASHION__ No, but she said all the high school girls were wearing them.  She said the style made your legs look long."
"__FASHION__ I heard the trend started in England and the model named Twiggy made them popular."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, Twiggy was one of the first super models."
"__FASHION__ Twiggy was also known for making the 'mode' dress popular."
"__FASHION__ Yes, and also for big big fake eyelashes."
"__FASHION__ I'm not keen on all 'flower power' designs though on the clothes from the 70s."
"__FASHION__ Me neither.  The current style bell bottoms don't have crazy flower patterns on them."
"__FASHION__ Yes, that makes them more versatile.  I saw Goldie Hawn wearing bell bottoms in a magazine.  She looked great."
"__FASHION__ Her daughter Kate Hudson has a fashion brand called Fabletics."
"__FASHION__ I have seen the commercials.  Talk about crazy patterns!  But the patterns look good on the exercise leggings."
"__FASHION__ True.  And the patterns are strategically placed so they make the wearer look slimmer."
"__FASHION__ The fabric is comfortable.  I have a pair and love them."
"__FASHION__ Do they wash well?"
"__FASHION__ Very well.  They retain their shape."
"__FASHION__ Can you put them in the drier?"
"__FASHION__ Yes but I don't like to."
"__FASHION__ I think it is better to hang dry most clothes so they don't fade."
