"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was a litte boring."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why do you say that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because there were new characters I suppose."
"__STAR_WARS__ OK I get where you are coming from."
"__STAR_WARS__ I just wanted the same characters from the first 6."
"__STAR_WARS__ But even when they did the first 3 they were all new."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah and it took forever to get attached to them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well Luke is grown up now."
"__STAR_WARS__ I hate his self exile. Think its lazy writing."
