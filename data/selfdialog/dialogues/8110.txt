"__POP__ So I was surprised by how much I like Harry Style's new music."
"__POP__ Same! Especially since I haven't been all that impressed by the other ones from One Direction."
"__POP__ Right? Like, I'll hear their stuff and I don't hate it, but I didn't go look it up to hear it again."
"__POP__ I never thought he release an album like that."
"__POP__ Me neither, I'm pleasantly surprised. It's got a very Paul McCartney-esque sound to it."
"__POP__ Yes! And some David Bowie too. You can really hear the British influence to it, not just pop."
"__POP__ Good point. I think I'm going to listen to the whole album, I've only listened to a couple of the songs."
"__POP__ You should, it's really good."
"__POP__ Did you see the video for Sign of the Times though?"
"__POP__ It's weird, I know. I couldn't even watch the whole thing."
