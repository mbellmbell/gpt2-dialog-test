"__DISNEY__ I have that Christina Aguilera song stuck in my head. From that Disney film."
"__DISNEY__ You mean the one that takes place in China?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Mulan. I used to love that film."
"__DISNEY__ Same, but I have to say I remember more about the soundtrack than I do about the film."
"__DISNEY__ You and me both, actually. That's why that song is stuck in my head."
"__DISNEY__ It's a good one, but that 'Make a Man Out of You' song was the big one."
"__DISNEY__ Did you know that song was actually sung by Donny Osmond?"
"__DISNEY__ Are you serious? That's so funny!"
"__DISNEY__ I know! I think I want to watch the movie again now."
"__DISNEY__ You should. It's one of the last great animated films!"
