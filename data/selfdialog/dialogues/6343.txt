"__STAR_WARS__ What are your thoughts on the remastering of Episodes 4, 5, and 6?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, that's a tough question.  On one hand, it allows Lucas to fulfill his vision of the universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ How is that the case?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, better special effects allows him to make every shot look exactly like he thought."
"__STAR_WARS__ That sounds like it's a good thing, overall."
"__STAR_WARS__ It certainly could be, but don't you think that this diminishes from the original work?"
"__STAR_WARS__ How do you figure so?  The original was rife with poor special effects!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true!  But somebody on the production team made those special effects."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ah, so you're claiming that by redoing those effects, you're removing those artist's work from the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly!  And because the original versions aren't also released, save on VHS, we may lose those forever."
