"__BEATLES__ You remember that rumor that Paul was dead?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah. Supposedly he was replaced by a double."
"__BEATLES__ Ridiculous. At that time, the early sixties, stuff was hard to refute to the fans.."
"__BEATLES__ Let's see, the left foot right foot 'evidence'."
"__BEATLES__ Yes. The double was just for show and George Martin wrotw the 'Paul' songs."
"__BEATLES__ How about the one that some song actually had the phrase 'Paul is dead'"
"__BEATLES__ I don't remember the song, but yes."
"__BEATLES__ Long time ago, I tried that. It was a vinyl disc."
"__BEATLES__ Was it true?"
"__BEATLES__ I can't say it sounded like what people describe."
