"__MOVIES__ What's your favourite movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I've had different favourites over the years. Let's see, I'd have to say the Princess Bride."
"__MOVIES__ Why's that?"
"__MOVIES__ It has so many classic scenes, and characters, and lines, it's funny, emotional and exciting."
"__MOVIES__ It sounds pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ What about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm a big Lord of the Rings fan."
"__MOVIES__ Oh okay. I don't remember much about it except Liv Tyler was in them."
"__MOVIES__ Would you be interested in watching them again with me sometime?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'm definitely about that, especially seeing my girl Liv Tyler."
"__MOVIES__ I think they're best watched back to back."
"__MOVIES__ That's how I watched them years ago."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I think it really helps with the storyline and everything to have a little marathon."
"__MOVIES__ Mhmm, otherwise I'd have to rewatch the end of the previous one to keep it fresh in my head."
"__MOVIES__ There definitely is a lot to keep track of."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like I need more info on the characters and the plot written down to be able to understand everything well."
"__MOVIES__ You know, there are resources like that you can find online."
"__MOVIES__ That would help me a ton."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I lost the stuff I had but we can find it again."
"__MOVIES__ That would make all the difference. I'm ready for a marathon!"
