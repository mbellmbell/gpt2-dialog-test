"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Bill Romanowski is pretty crazy, even by linebacker standards!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would say he's crazy by any standards!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he's ashamed of himself for punching that one tight end in the eye!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah really.  He ended the guys career with one punch.  People that strong shouldn't punch people, period."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ From what I remember, he crushed the guy's eye socket.  It was his own team member too and it happened during a scrimmage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, he also attacked people who weren't on his team, while playing the game in arenas too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, from what I remember he punched a guy, he kicked a guy in the head and he banged helmets with someone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true.  Kerry Collins was the quarterback of the Carolina Panthers, and it broke his jaw!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I just looked it up and he was fined $20,000."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's good. Marcus Williams is the teammate whose eye socket he crushed with the punch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he sued him and claimed that he was on steroids and that's what made him so aggressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well that totally reminds me that he was involved with BALCO labs and the whole scandal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?  I didn't know that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes it's true.  He was totally on steroids, 'the clear' and 'the cream'."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wow, same as Barry Bonds and those other guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep.  He was always really big on a lot of different things to keep himself in top shape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That I knew.  For some reason I didn't know he was on all sorts of steroids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he was.  They were designer staroids."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Amazing.  He just left no stone unturned in his quest to be the best athlete he could."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, but it's too bad he was a slapper of people."
