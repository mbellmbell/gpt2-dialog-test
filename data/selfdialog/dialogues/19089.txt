"__MOVIES__ Did you make it out to see Wonder Woman yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No! I really need to. How was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was amazing. I haven't felt that inspired in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Just seeing a woman in such a powerful role, and she really killed it!"
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome. I was reading an article about all these young girls that were dressing up as her for school."
"__MOVIES__ I saw that too; it was adorable!"
"__MOVIES__ I clearly need to go see it."
"__MOVIES__ There was a scene where Wonder Woman sneaked a sword into a party by wearing it in the back of her dress, and now there's tutorials for doing that all over the internet."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds amazing. How do you get a full sword in a dress?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea, but she did it and looked great!"
"__MOVIES__ Who played Wonder Woman again?"
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot. She was completely stunning. Plus Chris Pine was awesome in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I love Chris Pine. He was in the new Star Trek films right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he was Jim Kirk."
"__MOVIES__ Right, I think he did a great interpretation of Kirk."
"__MOVIES__ Oh for sure, not to mention their Spock. Zachary Quinto is too good."
"__MOVIES__ Oh absolutely, he looked just like Nimoy!"
"__MOVIES__ I really believed I was watching a story about the original cast. I love those films."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, I hope they keep putting out more!"
