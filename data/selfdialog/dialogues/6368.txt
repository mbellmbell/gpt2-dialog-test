"__STAR_WARS__ When you watch the original trilogy now, what do you think of the antiquated special effects?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would call them 'classic' rather than 'antiquated.'"
"__STAR_WARS__ Why sugar-coat it? They're obsolete now, with CGI doing all the effects that anyone could imagine."
"__STAR_WARS__ But look at the CGI in the second trilogy. It's soulless."
"__STAR_WARS__ Some people would say it's beautiful, perfect."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's part of why I like classic animation like matte paintings and stop-motion better. It's not perfect."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't get you. Isn't its perfection a distraction from the story?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, it reminds me, even on a subliminal level, that human beings sweated blood and worked a zillion hours to make it happen."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I see your point. More hands-on makes it meaningful to you."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly. I admire the special effects teams who worked on the original trilogy, because of the hard hands-on work they did to make those films effective."
