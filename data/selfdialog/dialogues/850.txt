"__MUSIC__ Did you pick up the new limited edition Clutch release?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I almost pre-ordered it, but money is tight. I have tickets to see them this summer though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah? With Primus?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that should be quite a show."
"__MUSIC__ I'd imagine so. I've never seen Primus."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither, and I'm not really a huge fan, but I'm looking forward to it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've always appreciated the way Les plays bass, and Herb's style on drums is perfect."
"__MUSIC__ Right, but it gets to feel kind of gimmicky after a while, just Les showing off."
"__MUSIC__ Wonder how the sets will compare between them and Clutch."
"__MUSIC__ Not having any experience with a Primus show, I have no idea, but we both know how shows with just Clutch are."
"__MUSIC__ I need to see them again -- haven't seen them since the Beale Street tour."
"__MUSIC__ I read somewhere just today about someone who saw them at 'Toolfest' -- I don't even know what that is."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think it was an actual thing -- like not by that name -- but Tool played with a bunch of other bands."
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, seeing Tool and Clutch at the same show would be amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I only hope I get the chance to see Tool again. I'm surprised they're even touring now."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they supposedly have a new album in the works."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, as they have for several years now."
"__MUSIC__ How long has it been since 10,000 Days?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not even sure. I'd have to look it up, but they're output sure doesn't compare to the way Clutch steadily keeps the releases coming."
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely. Probably, what, more than twice as many records as Tool in just about the same amount of time?"
