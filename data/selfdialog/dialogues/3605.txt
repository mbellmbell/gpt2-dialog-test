"__MUSIC__ I want to talk about hip-hop. What are your thoughts on Common?"
"__MUSIC__ He has great songs but he expirements too much."
"__MUSIC__ Ha ha, yeah, Electric Circus.  I think his songs are great."
"__MUSIC__ I wish he would rap more than act.  Just Wright wasn't really that good."
"__MUSIC__ I've seen worse, but I agree.  I want more songs like I used to Love H.E.R."
"__MUSIC__ The best hip-hop artists are truly poets.  I feel the same way about Nas."
"__MUSIC__ I agree.  That one song where he sings like he is a gun is brillant."
"__MUSIC__ Ilmatic is still his best albulm."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but Hip Hop is Dead is brillant as well."
"__MUSIC__ I think my favorite song off that album was the one where he sampled Unforgettable."
"__MUSIC__ You know, sampling is a tradition really borrowed from classical music."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that."
"__MUSIC__ Brahams sampled some of Handel's music and wrote his own variations."
"__MUSIC__ I know that popular music in the mid-twentith century and rock 'n roll used some other music."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like I'm Always Chasing Rainbows is based on Chopin."
"__MUSIC__ And the Beattles used some classical pieces in their music."
"__MUSIC__ So Hip-Hop really gets a bad rap (pun intended) about using other music."
"__MUSIC__ Then you have groups like the Roots that have a live band."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know how people realize they are a hip hop group."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  I'm glad they are on the tonight show but I had to think about people forgetting their great rap songs."
