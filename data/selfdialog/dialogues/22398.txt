"__DISNEY__ Do you like the movie Peter Pan?"
"__DISNEY__ The animated one from Disney? Yes!"
"__DISNEY__ I wanted to be Wendy Darling so much growing up."
"__DISNEY__ Her character is so cute and posh."
"__DISNEY__ She's also so fearless and firm in her beliefs."
"__DISNEY__ I related to her a lot growing up too, feeling a lot more adult than you really were."
"__DISNEY__ Oh yes, she did become the Lost Boy's mother after all."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, well not long after Wendy's mother became most of their mothers."
"__DISNEY__ Yes that is true."
"__DISNEY__ It's a shame Peter didn't come with the rest of the Lost Boys to stay with Wendy."
