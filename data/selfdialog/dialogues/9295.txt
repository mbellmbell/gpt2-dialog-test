"__BASEBALL__ The cubs lost to the brewers today"
"__BASEBALL__ What was the score?"
"__BASEBALL__ 6-3 Brewers."
"__BASEBALL__ Darn it. I really thought the cubs were going to go on a run"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah me too. The Brewers have really been playing well."
"__BASEBALL__ Yep. You have to give them a lot of credit for how they have been playing."
"__BASEBALL__ For sure. This was a big win for the Brewers. Even though it's early in the season."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. You want to show everyone that you are going to be a contender"
"__BASEBALL__ Plus this instills confidence in the team that they can compete against the top teams."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, I don't think anyone envisioned them in 1st place at all this season"
"__BASEBALL__ I know I didn't see that coming, but kudos to them for their performance."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they actually had to comeback in this game."
"__BASEBALL__ And they had to deal with a rain delayed game that can sometimes mess up your rhythm."
"__BASEBALL__ Absolutely. I think MLB messed up though. They should have called this game earlier."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Guys were slipping out there and making mistakes in the rain. Somebody could have gotten hurt."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh I see. Yeah that is dangerous and a little bit irresponsible of the league."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah. Hopefully we won't see that too often going forward."
"__BASEBALL__ I know they want to get these games in, but you got to protect the players."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah you do. You can't have people getting hurt, when it is absolutely unnecessary."
