"__MUSIC__ Who is the greatest living film music composer?"
"__MUSIC__ Ooooh, tough one, but great question."
"__MUSIC__ Are you going to answer?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, there are three or four possibilities."
"__MUSIC__ And they are?"
"__MUSIC__ John Williams, Danny Elfman, and Hans Zimmer."
"__MUSIC__ Of those, I prefer Zimmer."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ His music is so alive, so driving, and great for action."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but that's about all he can do."
"__MUSIC__ He's about the same as Elfman for me."
"__MUSIC__ Elfman too, is a bit limited. His genre is 'weird'"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, yeah."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to go with John Williams."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, outside of being the most nominated composer ever, including Star Wars..."
"__MUSIC__ yeah, yeah,"
"__MUSIC__ He uses leitmotifs more than any other composer out there."
"__MUSIC__ What's that mean?"
"__MUSIC__ That's where each character gets its own theme which is used throughout the movie. It gives them their own character and constantly changes, with them."
