"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How do you like these new artists like Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh they're some of my favorites. They've got this new flow that I really enjoy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah I get what you're saying, it's not like as aggressive as some of that stuff from back in the day."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What are you talking about? I mean the way he speaks his raps -- who did you know that was aggressive?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well I mean, just off the top of my head? Three Six Mafia, 'Slob On My Nob' was downright dirty!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Haha, you're right about that. But don't forget about Lil' Wayne, he was one of the greatest, and had some chill songs."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah you are right, I remember listening to 'Hustler Musik' and just kicking it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh that was a really good one. But honestly even his more hype stuff was great, remember The Carter?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ How could I forget? 'This is the Carter, so hold on to your teenage daughters!'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Haha! Lil' Wayne has got to get back to that level."
