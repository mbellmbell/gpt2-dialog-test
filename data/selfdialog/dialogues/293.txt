"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Coldplay?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a great question. I used to love them."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They write really good melodies. Their production is always fantastic."
"__MUSIC__ That is true. Brian Eno produced Viva La Vida."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, they always get great producers. But it was around that album actually that I changed my mind."
"__MUSIC__ Why was that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well up until Viva La Vida they had really solid songs, I still think that. But after that. I couldn't stand their new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ You think it was worse than the older songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Definitely. Think about it."
"__MUSIC__ Think about what?"
"__MUSIC__ When they first started off, like their first few albums- their songs actually had lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they did have lyrics. What's your point?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, as they kept releasing albums, their songs started being mostly  the word 'woah' or 'ahhhhh' or 'oooooh'"
"__MUSIC__ Wait, you're right."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Like every song since then has been some sort of nonsense chorus."
"__MUSIC__ Now that I think about it, totally. Chris Martin just throws in a lyric like, 'I sing' before the nonsense, and then there are no lyrics after that."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. So yeah, I used to like them."
"__MUSIC__ And now they sing nonsense songs."
"__MUSIC__ Every single one."
