"__ACTION__ Have you ever seen The Matrix?"
"__ACTION__ Yes I have seen all of them and I loved them."
"__ACTION__ I really liked the first two, but the last one didn't make sense to me."
"__ACTION__ Yeah it was kind of weird how they ended the series."
"__ACTION__ I really loved how they displayed the virus of the program as 'agents'."
"__ACTION__ I like how in the second movie they show the agents all forming into one more powerful agent."
"__ACTION__ I think the first matrix is probably Keanu Reeves best movie ever."
"__ACTION__ I totally agree with you. He is a really cool actor for that role."
"__ACTION__ Its amazing how much time and effort they put into making the first matrix movie."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, it ended up with some really good fight scenes and bullet dodging."
