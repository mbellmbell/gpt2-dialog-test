"__MUSIC__ Whatcha listening to?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a playlist of covers by KHS."
"__MUSIC__ Who's KHS?"
"__MUSIC__ Kurt Hugo Schneider. He's a really popular YouTuber."
"__MUSIC__ Does he sing, or?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he does sing, but mostly he collaborates with other YouTubers to make cover songs."
"__MUSIC__ What, he can't make up his own music?"
"__MUSIC__ You've clearly never seen any of his videos, the guy's brilliant."
"__MUSIC__ Then why's he have to cover other songs?"
"__MUSIC__ That's just what he likes to do; he takes a normal pop song and turns it into something really cool."
"__MUSIC__ What's so cool about a cover?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he creates the music by using really random things--one time, for example, he did the entire background beat of a song by using the sounds made by opening and closing car doors, turning on signals, changing gears, stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of cool. So is he like a mixtape artist?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of. He plays the piano, guitar, tambourine, and like I said, pretty much any item you can think of. He sings, too."
"__MUSIC__ So if he can sing, why does he get other people to do it in his videos?"
"__MUSIC__ He's a big picture artist, I think, so he wants the singer to match the song perfectly."
"__MUSIC__ That makes sense, I guess."
"__MUSIC__ He's also a brilliant cinematographer. He has several one-take videos that are just fabulous."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, maybe I should check him out after all!"
"__MUSIC__ Totally! He's been around since 2010 or so, and all his music is solid."
