"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What kind of music do you listen to while drunk?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ The same thing that everyone does."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Which is?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Classical music with tons of brass, percussion, dissonance, and chromatic harmonies."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Umm, I don't agree with that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ No really, I enjoy it and analyze and appreciate it more when tipsy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Probably because my mind is open more and I hear things I hadn't before. What about you?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Teen pop music with female singers."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Seriously? You're a 35 year old male."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah, I know."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok, who specifically?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, I subscribe to Katy Perry, Sia, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande, and Lady Gaga to start."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Some of them are pretty talented."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Some?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Well, neither Katy nor Selena can really go full-on when live, and Ariana's voice is a bit too light."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ True on Ariana, that's why she wasn't good in Hairspray."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like Sia as her voice carries forever."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I'll try your drunk classical. Recommend me something?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Shostakovich Symphony no. 10, movements 2 and 4."
