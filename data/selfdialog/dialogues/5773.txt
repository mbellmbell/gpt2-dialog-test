"__STAR_WARS__ I wonder where the Jedi *originally* came from."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you suppose that they'll answer that definitively in The Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hope so!  As the last of the nine films oriented around the original Star Wars, there are a lot of questions I hope that they'll tie up!"
"__STAR_WARS__ What I'd like to see is some more force ghosts, like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker at the end of The Empire Strikes Back!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that title -- The Last Jedi -- is actually a teaser: I think we'll actually see Luke *re-establish* the Jedi Order."
"__STAR_WARS__ Huh. Will Kylo Ren re-establish the Sith too, then?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No, I think we'll really see the end of the *Sith*, not the Jedi Order. I just have a lot of faith in George Lucas' positive vision."
"__STAR_WARS__ And where does Rey fit in?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Good question!  I think when we find out where *she* came from, it will answer many questions!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I see Luke setting up a new Jedi Order, with Rey at the head of it -- wouldn't *that* be cool!"
