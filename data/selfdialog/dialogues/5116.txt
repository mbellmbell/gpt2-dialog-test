"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why are the Fast and Furious movies shown out of order?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think because after #3 - Tokyo Drift - they did not think the franchise would come back."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why, because Vin Diesl was off staring in Triple X movies?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes and because for the second movie, Paul Walker couldn't really carry it alone."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Paul Walker wasn't in the Fast 8 movie was he?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ No, he died during the filming of Fast and Furious 7 so they just did not include him or Jordanna Brewster, who plays Mia."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Is Fast 8 just as good as the rest?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I think so, it has a good storyline, but I honestly think they should have stopped after Fast and Furious 7."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Do you think they will go all the way to 10?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Hard to say, but I think all the stars would definitely do it becaus the Fast and Furious franchise still makes a lot of money worldwide."
