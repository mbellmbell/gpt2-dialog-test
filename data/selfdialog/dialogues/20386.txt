"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite violent movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Violent movie, let me see. Are we including horror movies or just action?"
"__MOVIES__ Everything included, all genres. What do you like the most?"
"__MOVIES__ If I'm counting horror movies I have to say The Hills Have Eyes Two. That movie was just great."
"__MOVIES__ That wasn't a bad one. I actually really enjoyed all of the Saw movies."
"__MOVIES__ Now we're talking nostalgia. When it comes to horror I'll take gore over ghost movies any day."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that was an annoying trend that was going around for a while. Nothing but ghost movies as far as the eye can see."
"__MOVIES__ And those Paranormal Activity movies. They just won't stop making them!"
"__MOVIES__ I did see a horror movie recently that I thought was very original and cool. It was called Don't Breathe."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like a really familiar title. What was that about again?"
"__MOVIES__ It was a really interesting take on horror. The antagonist was an old, blind veteran."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds interesting. He was the bad guy?"
"__MOVIES__ It's this blind guy that gets robbed, and the robbers are actually who you feel bad for. He does insane things to them."
"__MOVIES__ Wow I am absolutely going to have to see that now. That kind of reminds me of a full length movie I saw on Netflix recently."
"__MOVIES__ Oh was it good? What was it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was called Hush. It's about a deaf girl and this criminal who torments her."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds very interesting! I'll look that one up for sure."
"__MOVIES__ It was very well executed. I thought it was going to be awful, but it turned out really great."
"__MOVIES__ I like that they're starting to come up with some more original ideas for these movies now. Keeps the genre fresh."
"__MOVIES__ You've got that right. I'm a big fan of new things and switching it up."
