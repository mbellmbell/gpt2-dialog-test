"__MUSIC__ So, have you seen the movie The Aristocats?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that's an awesome movie!  I love the cats in that one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they are precious.  Marie the little white one is so cute."
"__MUSIC__ I know!  It has some really funny parts and songs, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they definitely stick in your head.  I love cartoon movies about animals."
"__MUSIC__ I do too!  The Rats of Nimh is another good one, have you seen it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it came out around the same time didn't it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I believe so.  It's a great story about a bunch of mice that live in a field and has mystery and intrigue, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I think it's based off a book isn't it?"
"__MUSIC__ I really don't know about that, but I know it's a great movie."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever see Charlotte's Web?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, that is a sad one.  It's not as good as the book but it is a great movie."
"__MUSIC__ It has a good soundtrack, too."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it has some good sing a longs."
"__MUSIC__ Wasn't the Aristocats a Disney movie?"
"__MUSIC__ I believe it was.  It was a lesser well-known one, but it was still great."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder why it wasn't as popular as some of the others."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  The story drags a little here and there, maybe that's why."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't think that it dragged."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, well I did, but I guess it's a matter of opinion."
