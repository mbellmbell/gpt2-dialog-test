"__DISNEY__ Have you ever seen The Parent Trap?"
"__DISNEY__ The one with Lindsay Lohan and Dennis Quaid?"
"__DISNEY__ No, the original one with Maureen O'Hara, Brian Keith, and Hailey Mills."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't know there was another version.  How is it?"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it better than the remake, but then in most cases, the originals tend to be better."
"__DISNEY__ That's true.  So what was your favorite part of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I think the camping trip where they got rid of the fianc√©e.  Putting honey on Vicky so that the bear licked her feet was really funny."
"__DISNEY__ Honey on her feet?  That's kind of mean, isn't it?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess so, but it was really funny.  I just really liked the whole thing."
"__DISNEY__ I guess maybe I'll have to watch it because the part you described to me sounds really funny.  Mean, but funny."
