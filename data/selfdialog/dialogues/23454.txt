"__DISNEY__ I see 'Cars 3' is now in theaters."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I know.  I don't know if I want to go and see it though?"
"__DISNEY__ Why not? Did you see the first two?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I did. I liked the first one, but the second one was not as good."
"__DISNEY__ I know what you mean. And Michael Keaton doesn't do the voice of 'Thunder' like he did in the first one."
"__DISNEY__ It does look a lot like the first movie though, with all the racing."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the way that the main character, Lightning McQueen, takes on the role as a mentor."
"__DISNEY__ It sort of brings the movie full circle in that regard."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe I'll just wait to see it when it comes out on DVD."
"__DISNEY__ That's what I was thinking, too."
