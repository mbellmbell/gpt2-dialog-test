"__DISNEY__ It's an older stop motion animation movie from the 90s."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, I didn't realize it's been out a long time. What happens in it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well the Pumpkin King, Jack Skellington, is like the ruler of Halloween. It starts out on Halloween night, but Jack feels like something is missing, so he tries to take over Christmas after discovering a door to Christmas town in the woods."
