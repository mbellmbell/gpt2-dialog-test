"__BEATLES__ Did you ever see the beatles perform live?"
"__BEATLES__ No too young, my parents did."
"__BEATLES__ Mine too I think my dad still has his ticket stub."
"__BEATLES__ I wonder if it would be worth any big money?"
"__BEATLES__ I doubt it, but we joke that if we ever get on antiques roadshow we may bring it and all his albums."
"__BEATLES__ That is funny, but might profit. He has original albums or re releases?"
"__BEATLES__ My father has some of both, well all the re released everything but some originals still."
"__BEATLES__ That is cool. i know the later stuff is suppose to sound better being remastered."
"__BEATLES__ It is remastered but I still prefer the older original ones, I like a little crackle in the records."
"__BEATLES__ Well to each there own. I like a clean sound myself but can see the charm of what you enjoy."
