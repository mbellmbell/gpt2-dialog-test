"__MUSIC__ What do you like to listen to when you exercise."
"__MUSIC__ A bit of everything. Usually higher tempo, you?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to a bit of everything, but there are certain things I wouldn't normally listen to that I listen to while workingout."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Like I love hip hop, but I find a lot of 'trap music' to be vulgar. However, the beats are so good for running, it really pumps me up."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean! I'm a huge Chief Keef fan when I work out!"
"__MUSIC__ Ha! Ha! Him and Bobby Shmurda!"
"__MUSIC__ Right on, right on. I listen to a lot of stuff though: The Strokes, Kanye West, Daft Punk, YG, Prince, Black Kids."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the music really motivates me to get out there and running. Do you change up your playlists?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I can do a playlist that gets light revisions for a couple of weeks. After that it's out with the old in with the new."
"__MUSIC__ True, if you're working out a lot stuff tends to get old. Have you ever tried working out without music."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I know it's supposed to be all good and meditative, but I can't get into it. I need something to distract me from the pain sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I need Kanye and Kendrick and Julian Casablancas to distract me!"
"__MUSIC__ Right? I worry I am blowing out my ears though."
"__MUSIC__ Why's that?"
"__MUSIC__ I listen to my music with over the head earphones so loudly!"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds dangerous too if you're doing street running."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, sometimes I can't hear cars. It's a really bad habit, but it's hard to not pump up Yeezus all the way when you're hitting your fifth mile."
"__MUSIC__ I get the impulse. Music is meant to be played loud."
"__MUSIC__ It's much better loud. The hearing loss is the side effect of the pleasure."
