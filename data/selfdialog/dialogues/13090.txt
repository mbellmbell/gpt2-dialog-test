"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, the NFL season is coming up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I am aware. I'm really excited. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. I am going to be rooting for my favorite team!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is your favorite team by the way?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ My favorite team is the Washington Redskins."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh ok."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's the problem?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the Redskins haven't made any advancement from the playoffs to the Super Bowl since the late 90s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I understand that but I always love a great defensive team. What is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Dallas Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard their new stadium is really massive and great for hosting the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course. As long as Tony Romo doesn't get any injuries this year it's all in the bag."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The game isn't won on soley defense. Besides, Romo is getting old don't you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is coming from a Redskins fan? You lost RGIII. Please don't give me a lecture."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Realistically, Romo probably has another season left in him and then he is out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We will see. How about your draft picks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the draft picks? I'm confident in the choices they made."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I never really am. They just don't listen to the teams and take in consideration for things."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Things such as what?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Salary."
