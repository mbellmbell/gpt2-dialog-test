"__BEATLES__ I was thinking the other day about Beatles music and a discussion between my husband and my son from a previous marriage."
"__BEATLES__ What in particular sticks out about the conversation?"
"__BEATLES__ Well it was probably 12 years ago and my husband was trying to help my son become a better guitar player.. He suggested that he learn some Beatles tunes.."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah i can see why he would suggest them."
"__BEATLES__ Well surprisingly my son said he didn't like the Beatles. Well we were both quite surprised by his reply."
"__BEATLES__ Did he say why he didn't like them? Or who he did like?"
"__BEATLES__ I really don't recall his answer. However it was probably because he likes heavy metal and that was too light for him I suppose."
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles were and are one of my favorite go to bands."
"__BEATLES__ Yeah i can't imagine someone not liking The Beatles. Well some songs I could take or leave."
"__BEATLES__ Give me an example of a song you don't like. Any album of your choosing."
