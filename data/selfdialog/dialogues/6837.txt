"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have a favourite Star Wars character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Probably c3po. His sense of humor, and manner of speech are just so entertaining."
"__STAR_WARS__ I went as him for halloween one year!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh man, I wish I could've seen that! Yeah as an asexual I find him really relateable."
"__STAR_WARS__ But I thought you referred to some of the cast members as attractive."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah aesthetically. Harrison Ford for example, he's another reason I liked watching them so much."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ah I get it. Yeah I felt that way about Darth Vader, I had such a crush on him growing up."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm surprised you didn't go as him for Halloween."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, when cosplaying as Vader it would really be more about the clothes, mask and everything. I thought the character c3po lends itself well more to body paints and makeup type stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ That makes sense."
