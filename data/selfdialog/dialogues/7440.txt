"__LADY_GAGA__ Which Lady Gaga song is your favorite?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ My favorite would have to be her new song, 100 million reasons."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Really? Why do you like that song so much?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is such a soulful song that really conveys her emotions. Also, you can really see her artistic talent."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I like that song, but I really prefer her early stuff like Bad Romance."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Why do you prefer that song?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ It is so much more fun to dance to and it gets stuck in your head."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's true, but 100 million reasons is much easier on the ears."
"__LADY_GAGA__ True, but you've got to admit that Bad Romance is a guilty pleasure of yours."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, you'd be right about that."
