"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think the best tight end is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Of course, Rob Gronkowski."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hard to argue with that one - 25 Touchdowns in the last 3 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and he missed half of last season - he's awesome."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He reminds me a lot of Mark Bavaro."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The old Giants Tight End?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Bavaro was the best tight end for a short time, but he kept getting injured."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True Gronk is a sure fire hall of famer if he can stay healty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Travis Kelce, he's an up and coming young tight end."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He catches a lot of balls but doesn't seem to score as much as Gronk."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, look at who's throwing to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, Gronk has Brady; Kelce has Alex Smith!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ An underrated tight end is Greg Olsen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's had three straight 1,000 yard seasons and 16 touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is a consistent player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also like Jordan Reed for Washington."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is way too injury prone for me."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How about Jimmy Graham?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jimmy is a great tight end; who is finally learning the system in Seattle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought he career was over when he blew out his knee.  But, he's come back to be one of the best again!"
