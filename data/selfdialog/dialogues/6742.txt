"__STAR_WARS__ Looking  back  what do  you think of the  clone wars movie ?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked  parts of it  and it  sure was action packed ."
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked  Jackson playing  a  jedi ."
"__STAR_WARS__ It was a  shame that  fett  killed his  character ."
"__STAR_WARS__ I  kept  hoping he would  show back up  in  flash backs ."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well maybe in  another  movie  ."
"__STAR_WARS__ Its  cool  how  yoda  always shows up in  these movies"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well  he is the master ."
"__STAR_WARS__ I would  still like to  see  a  stand  alone  movie  with a  young  yoda ."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe  showing  how  he  finds the  force"
