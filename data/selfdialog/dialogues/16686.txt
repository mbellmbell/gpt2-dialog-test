"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you see the Wonder Woman movie in theaters right now?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I haven't actually, have you?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I watched it the night it was released because I was super excited about it!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that sounds very nice! How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed it actually, I thought the casting was perfect."
"__MOVIES__ Right, didn't the female lead get some criticism when people first found out she was casted?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but I think Gal Gadot actually did an amazing job as Diana."
"__MOVIES__ That's great to hear! A female superhero movie doing well is really exciting to hear about."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't."
"__MOVIES__ I think I might, but I don't have any background knowledge on DC Comics or anything of the sort."
"__MOVIES__ That's completely fine, I didn't have any knowledge either."
"__MOVIES__ Really? And you still enjoyed it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I think it's fantastic, especially because it's a movie about where Wonder Woman came from."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, that sounds great! I'll be buying tickets on Fandango."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. I definitely did that for opening night because I thought the seats would be sold out."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I'm thinking. It usually takes away the rush and worry about not getting a seat after you drive to the theater."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and don't forget your popcorn and ICEE at the theater!"
"__MOVIES__ I will most definitely get some to enjoy during the movie!"
"__MOVIES__ Great, let me know what you think of it after you watch it. You won't be disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I will definitely let you know!"
