"__MOVIES__ I saw a great movie yesterday."
"__MOVIES__ Really? What movie?"
"__MOVIES__ The Devil Wears Prada. I loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ With Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes! It's based on a book written by Lauren Weisberger. Did you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ I did! It's a fantastic movie."
"__MOVIES__ Meryl Streep's character Miranda Priestley was ruthless!! She was one tough cookie!"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, she was. I think she had to be to make sure the Runway magazine performed as it should have."
"__MOVIES__ I was surprised that Andy was even hired in the beginning. She didn't fit the mold of being the 'New Emily'"
"__MOVIES__ That's why Miranda chose her. She was different than the other girls, she wanted to see what she could do."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think when Andy took the trip to Paris instead of Emily?"
"__MOVIES__ She shouldn't have done it, but Emily wasn't always so nice to her so and Miranda might've fired her otherwise."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. I like that she realized she was becoming someone else and decided to leave the job in the end."
"__MOVIES__ She did the right thing. Just a shame her relationship with Nate didn't work out."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, they made a cute couple."
"__MOVIES__ I felt bad for Nigel when Miranda appointed Jaqueline to his position instead of him."
"__MOVIES__ That was messed up. She did it to save herself, but that was wrong."
"__MOVIES__ It really was. Meryl Streep is a great actress!"
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that for the scene when she cried about her divorce it was her idea to do it without make-up?"
"__MOVIES__ No way! Really?"
