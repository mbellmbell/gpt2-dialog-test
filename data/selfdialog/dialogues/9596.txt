"__COMEDY__ Have you ever seen the movie, Borat?"
"__COMEDY__ I love that movie! it is hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ A lot of foreign people really hate it because they think it mocks their culture and is an improper representation of foreigners."
"__COMEDY__ That's what makes it so funny though! I feel like if you cant enjoy it for its humor you are just stuck up."
"__COMEDY__ Definitely, I feel the same way."
"__COMEDY__ I mean, I could see how someone can be offended by it."
"__COMEDY__ Me too, but if you are, its probably because you know some of that stuff actually is true."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, if it was a complete facade then people would know it doesn't represent them."
"__COMEDY__ Agreed. The way they make it over the top clearly shows its just a goof."
"__COMEDY__ If anything though, they could have had less male nudity. I wasn't a fan of that, haha."
