"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ I just dont see the allure of buying CDs."
"__MUSIC__ I think that they have already moved away from that platform."
"__MUSIC__ I just dont see how digital sales can be completely ignored."
"__MUSIC__ They arent, thats how they figure numbers out."
"__MUSIC__ I am just surprised we dont see a different model outside of that."
"__MUSIC__ I am not following, how else would you monetize it?"
"__MUSIC__ Ticket sales for shows."
"__MUSIC__ Some bands dont go on tour as much."
"__MUSIC__ I know but I think thats how bands make money."
"__MUSIC__ I believe in music they make money off of merchandise sales."
"__MUSIC__ Well that could be it"
"__MUSIC__ I dont love the way the music industry is modeled anymore though."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, it seems like smaller bands get squeezed."
"__MUSIC__ I just think we are seeing the abandonment of DIY ethics as well."
"__MUSIC__ Thats just the world we live in."

"__MUSIC__ You could say that but I dont agree"
