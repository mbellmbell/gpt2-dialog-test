"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Last year the Rams moved to LA. The Chargers moved to LA starting in 2017."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A move I hate, by the way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I would rather see other places get NFL teams than LA get two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They nearly could have had three, but the Raiders will be going to Las Vegas in 2020."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That move I don't mind so much. Nevada didn't have an NFL team, so it's nice to see them get one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK then. If you could move two or three NFL teams or create expansion teams, where would you like to see them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For starters, I would move either the Rams or Chargers back out of LA."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Move one of them to Oakland or San Diego?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, yeah. I'd also like to see old NFL teams revived, at least in spirit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A lot of those defunct teams were in small towns that I don't think would be able to support a modern NFL franchise, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose so, but I'm thinking dream teams, not the reality of how they would work. So, Akron, Racine, Louisville."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Canton had a team at one point too, yeah? That would be a great option for a team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Canton Bulldogs were a team in the 20s, yes. It would be nice to see the town with the Hall of Fame have a team now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Outside of old defunct teams, where would you put a modern franchise?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oregon, maybe. New Mexico. Oklahoma."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about expanding outside of the continental US?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've always thought a Hawaii team would be neat, but travel would be an issue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd love to see a Mexican or Canadian team. International, but close enough so travel shouldn't be a huge deal."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Those would be really fun options."
