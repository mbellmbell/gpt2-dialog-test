"__BASEBALL__ So.....do you think that baseball players still retaliate against each other?"
"__BASEBALL__ You mean like throwing balls and bats at players?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah.  Like what happened between the Braves and Blue Jayes"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh yeah.  What was the deal with that?  Bautista seemed like he was looking for something."
"__BASEBALL__ When he smashed that homer and ran the bases Jace Peterson and Kurt Suzuki both said something to him."
"__BASEBALL__ And then on Thursday Teheran was trying to nail Bautista on the plate."
"__BASEBALL__ What was that first pitch, 94 mph?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yep, and it barely missed him.  Then his second throw, the one that hit Bautista, was recorded at 95 mph!"
"__BASEBALL__ The blue Jays crushed the Braves Thursday night."
"__BASEBALL__ Sure did!  With 3 in the first and 6 more in the second two innings!"
"__BASEBALL__ I wonder what Teheran was thinking about when he was pitching?"
"__BASEBALL__ Seemed like he would have been better off keeping his mind on the game instead of getting back at Bautista."
"__BASEBALL__ Even after he got hit the first time, the second time at bat he killed it again with a double!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he sure wasn't intimidated by Teheran!"
"__BASEBALL__ These are grown men.  You'd think they would be over trying to get even with one another."
"__BASEBALL__ Right?  It's not like it's sand lot baseball!"
"__BASEBALL__ What would have happened it one of his own players had gotten hurt?"
"__BASEBALL__ The Braves would have really been sucking wind then!"
"__BASEBALL__ All in all, let's just be grown ups and play ball here, okay?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds good to me!  Steerike!!"
