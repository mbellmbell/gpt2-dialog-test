"__HARRY_POTTER__ I watched the last two Harry Potter movies this past weekend."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What did you think?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They were pretty good. I wish I had seen them when they came out in theaters."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, it is more exciting to see the action taking place on the big screen."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ There were many scenes that had me holding my breath."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, right. I forgot you did not read the books. Which scenes are you talking about?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ For example, the scene where Harry, Ron, and Hermione were running away from the Death Eaters in the woods."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh yeah, and how about the scene when they visited Godric's Hollow and the old lady turned out to be the snake? That was scary."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But I thought the battle scene could have been more epic."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I thought it was well done."
