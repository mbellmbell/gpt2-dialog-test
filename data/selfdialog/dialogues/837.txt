"__MUSIC__ Did you go out to see the Elvis Costello concert last week?"
"__MUSIC__ No!  I didn't even know he played!  When was it?"
"__MUSIC__ The 13th of June - over at Heinz Hall."
"__MUSIC__ Man, that's awesome.  I'm sorry I missed it.  What did he play?"
"__MUSIC__ A lot of stuff off Imperial Bedrooms.  He ended up doing two sets."
"__MUSIC__ Did he play Alison?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah!  He actually played that acoustically with his backup singers.  It was really amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I am so jealous.  How did he sound?"
"__MUSIC__ He sounded good.  I mean, the sound in the theater was a little wonky, but Elvis himself sounded amazing.  He's definitely still got it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sorry I missed it.  Imperial Bedrooms is one of my favorite albums ever.  Did he play all the songs off of it?"
"__MUSIC__ Mostly!  He played Pidgin English, On the Way, You Little Fool, and other stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I love those songs!  What was your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ I loved when he played Watching the Detectives.  He was all awash in green light and it was super cool."
"__MUSIC__ Where were you sitting?"
"__MUSIC__ Front row center, if you believe it!  I about died!"
"__MUSIC__ I can imagine!  How did he look?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, he's much shorter in real life.  Also he looked pretty old."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he is old!"
"__MUSIC__ True.  All in all he sounded like the same Elvis Costello of years before."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool.  I can't believe I missed it!"
