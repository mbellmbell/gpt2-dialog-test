"__DISNEY__ Have you seen Big Hero 6?"
"__DISNEY__ I did! I watched it with my friends."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I loved it! The scene where Hiro watches his brother test Baymax was a real tear-jerker."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah  cried like a little baby on that scene. There's a rumor going around that they're planning on a prequel."
"__DISNEY__ I don't think that'll work. What do you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, Disney isn't really known for making good prequels or sequels."
"__DISNEY__ True. The movie was great, better than Frozen even."
"__DISNEY__ That's what I think so too. A prequel or sequel would just ruin it."
"__DISNEY__ Yea, not a big fan of sequels nor prequels."
