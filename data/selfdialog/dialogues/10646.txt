"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What was your favorite era of hip hop?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would definitely have to say the 80's. Between NWA and old school Nas, they definitely won me over."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can totally see that. I think I'm going to have to go with the early 90's, though."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Really? I never thought of the 90's as a staple in hip hop."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, I have for sure. I was won over by TLC and Wu-Tang."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Wu-Tang definitely is a class act. But weren't they popular in the 80's as well?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ A lot of people assume that, but they mainly got their break around '93."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That was a good year for hip hop. That was just a couple of years after Outkast was founded."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Outkast has always been one of my favorite hip hop groups since, 'Mrs. Jackson.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That definitely is one of the greatest hits of all time!"
