"__STAR_WARS__ It is universally acknowledged that 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best Star Wars movie.  Do you agree?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, clearly."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's the worst Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The first 2 prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ I tend to agree, although recently I watched 'The Return of the Jedi,' and it was pretty bad."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really, I remember liking it.  Of course, I was a kid."
"__STAR_WARS__ It shares many of the bad tendencies of the prequels: cuteness, too much (bad) dialogue, fuzzy action."
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought 'The Force Awakens' was a return to form, and may even be the second or third best of the films."
"__STAR_WARS__ You'd put it ahead of the original?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that argument could be made."
