"__STAR_WARS__ I'm really excited to see how they handle the Han Solo spin off."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, he's a very beloved character, it might be tough to do it justice."
"__STAR_WARS__ Agreed, Rogue One was handling a cast of unknowns so it was easy to win people over."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, we've already seen a young Han Solo in the original trilogy so it's going to be weird to see somebody that isn't Harrison Ford."
"__STAR_WARS__ I have to imagine they know what they're doing though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh definitely, the casting is pretty great, it'll just be weird since we already have that young frame of reference in mind."
"__STAR_WARS__ For sure, I'm interested to see Donald Glover take up the Lando role."
"__STAR_WARS__ He is mega talented so I know he's going to knock it out of the park."
"__STAR_WARS__ Lots of Star Wars to look forward to this and next year."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am glad to be along on the journey with you my friend."
