"__MOVIES__ Wanna watch a movie tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, what'd you have in mind?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I was thinking about that new Tupac movie."
"__MOVIES__ You mean All Eyez on Me?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ Is it online yet?"
"__MOVIES__ It should be. I checked last week though and it wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ I know. They trying to cut back on all the pirating I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Shoot, that corny Wonder Woman was online the day after it came out."
"__MOVIES__ Like you said, because it's corny."
"__MOVIES__ I started to take a peek at it then I was like, hell no."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah my dude. No cool points for watching Wonder Woman."
"__MOVIES__ It's like the movie industry can't come up with any original ideas."
"__MOVIES__ I know. They got a Baywatch movie and it's supposed to be a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ With The Rock in there. That thing look lame and stupid."
"__MOVIES__ Well if the 'Pac movie ain't online what are we going to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ Maybe we can just go to Redbox and find something."
"__MOVIES__ Let me know, I really could stand to watch a good flick."
"__MOVIES__ Well google some good titles and we will go together to find something."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, will do."
