"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I really miss Brian's character."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Me too.  Paul Walker was so great in his role."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Did you notice that they tried to replace him in the latest Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ How so?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They introduced Scott Eastwood's character as another Brian.  A law man who goes rogue."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Now that you mention it, he even drove a similar blue car as Brian."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Exactly.  I understand why they would try to do it, but I don't think it was executed correctly."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Indeed.  His character had a few lines but played no major role."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ There was a period of maybe 20 minutes or so where he just wasn't on screen."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Maybe they will better utilize his character in Fast 9."
