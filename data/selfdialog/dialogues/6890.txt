"__STAR_WARS__ I am definitely a Star Wars fanatic, I've seen every movie dozens of times."
"__STAR_WARS__ I like the movies, but it's definitely not something I'm in love with."
"__STAR_WARS__ I've even dressed up as a Storm trooper for Rouge One."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that is awesome, I've dressed up my dog as Yoda and an ewok before."
"__STAR_WARS__ It seems like you're a fan of the series than!"
