"__BASEBALL__ Did you see the Phillies game yesterday?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they are not a good team."
"__BASEBALL__ Why do you say that?"
"__BASEBALL__ Their pitching is terrible."
"__BASEBALL__ Is it relief or starting?"
"__BASEBALL__ A little bit of both."
"__BASEBALL__ Whats worse?"
"__BASEBALL__ I would say the relief pitching. Numbers wise."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the starter's ERA is not that bad."
"__BASEBALL__ I think it could be increased if they let them continue to pitch."
"__BASEBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__BASEBALL__ They yank them in the 5th almost every game."
"__BASEBALL__ OK so that expends the relievers?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yes and they arent that good to begin with."
"__BASEBALL__ So what do you think they need to do?"
"__BASEBALL__ I would go build out the starting pitching first."
"__BASEBALL__ Once you can get through 6 then you go to the pen"
"__BASEBALL__ So they dont need a closer?"
"__BASEBALL__ Wait until theyre good"
"__BASEBALL__ I understand"
