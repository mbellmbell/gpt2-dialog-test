"__MUSIC__ Are you familiar with the music of the band Genesis?"
"__MUSIC__ Sort of; i know some of their songs but not many."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know any of their early stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ You mean like the song, 'turn me on again?'"
"__MUSIC__ Actually they were around long before that song.  did you know Peter Gabriel was their original lead singer?"
"__MUSIC__ What? I didn't know Peter Gabriel had anything to do with Genesis."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he was the lead singer for the first six or so albums and then left the band."
"__MUSIC__ Was Genesis very popular when Gabriel was with them?"
"__MUSIC__ Only in England.  they didn't become extremely successful anywhere else until Phil Collins took over the vocals."
"__MUSIC__ I always thought Collins was the only lead singer the band ever had."
"__MUSIC__ Well, he was with the band from their third album on; but only as drummer and background singer.  then her took over lead vocals when Gabriel left."
"__MUSIC__ Holy cow; i had no idea.  whey did Gabriel leave? was he fired?"
"__MUSIC__ i don't think anyone but the band members know the real story.  it couldn't have been very nasty though, because Gabriel did appear with the band in a reunion tour."
"__MUSIC__ that's interesting.  i guess there wasn't too much bad blood about him leaving, then."
"__MUSIC__ either that or he just couldn't resist the money they were offering him to appear on the tour."
"__MUSIC__ LOL, that's right.  what's your favorite Genesis song?"
"__MUSIC__ oh, there are so many but if i had to pick one, it would have to be 'Paperlate,' from the early 1980s"
"__MUSIC__ I remember that song.  it was real catchy."
"__MUSIC__ it sure was and it did real well on the charts.  it's been nice talking to you about this legendary band."
"__MUSIC__ definitely; i appreciate all the knowledge you provided."
