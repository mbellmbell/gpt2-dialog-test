"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I feel like an old person when I listen to the radio."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Why?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Because I think thoughts like 'This isn't music. In my day, we had the real music.'"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. I can relate. You are having a 'get off my lawn' moment."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yes. I do honestly feel like music was much better a couple decades ago, but maybe I am crazy."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Maybe everybody feels this way."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ My parents definitely said it to me."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. Mine as well."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I liked my parents music very much, though."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What kind of stuff did they listen to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ A lot of mellow stuff that might be considered cheesy by some, but I grew up listening to it, so I love it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I love, love, love The Carpenters. My mom liked them."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Karen Carpenter had the voice of an angel."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Agreed. Her voice and they lyrics. Top notch stuff. Also, my mom had a lot of Simon and Garfunkel albums which I deeply love."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh yeah. They wrote many good tunes."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ We had a lot of bad pop music back when I was a kid in the eighties, you know, but there just seemed to be far more variety on the radio."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah. You could hear r&b, rap, heavy metal and pop all on the same station."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Totally. I miss that."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ There are still many great artists making music, you just have to search for them. Radio has gotten pretty bad."
