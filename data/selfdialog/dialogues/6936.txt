"__STAR_WARS__ What do you think will happen in the new Star Wars movie, the Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, but I'm happy to see Luke Skywalker back in action. I think they'll kill Leia off screen as a result of Carrie Fisher's death too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did, I really enjoyed seeing a story not focus on the Jedi and instead on the more regular people. It felt like a war movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who is your favorite character in the Star Wars Universe?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really like Han Solo. Harrison Ford is a good actor and Solo has those rogueish qualities that I really like."
"__STAR_WARS__ What is your favorite Star Wars movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it has to be Empire Strikes Back. It's one of the more focused and dramatic stories, and the Darth Vader scenes are fantastic and full of suspense."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you enjoy the Star Wars prequels?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think there are some things that the movies do well, but that the dialogue and story aren't good enough to watch as an adult."
