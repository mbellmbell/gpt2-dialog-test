"__MOVIES__ You know what the most unlikely romantic movie in the world is?"
"__MOVIES__ No, what?"
"__MOVIES__ Ronin. That is the most unappreciated romantic movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ What? I don't even recall there being a romance in Ronin."
"__MOVIES__ There really never was, which made it a sad romantic movie, but a romantic movie none the less."
"__MOVIES__ Please explain."
"__MOVIES__ Robert De Niro's character, Sam, and Dierdre, they get dressed up and go out to do some surveillance...."
"__MOVIES__ I've never found surveillance to be romantic."
"__MOVIES__ Then maybe you aren't doing it right. They pose as man and wife, and there's this awkwardness at pretending to be a couple."
"__MOVIES__ I remember."
"__MOVIES__ And then they're in the car doing surveillance, and another car passes and they kiss to seem like there's nothing suspicious about them sitting there in this parked car."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I remember. Then things really get hot."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but that's it. It never gets to develop into anything more."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they're pulled apart shortly after that."
"__MOVIES__ And then he sees her at the ice skating rink. And she asks him to just leave with her, leave everything behind. And he admits to her that he's a secret agent, he's been undercover this whole time..."
"__MOVIES__ I remember that now."
"__MOVIES__ You can see by the look on his face there's nothing he'd rather do than get in the car with her, but he knows they'd never get away. And so he does the one thing he can do: he saves her from getting caught."
"__MOVIES__ And she looks up at him, and she looks just devastated."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Then she drives off without a word."
"__MOVIES__ And in the end, even Vincent knew there was something there, because he reminds him that she would never come back to the place where they met."
