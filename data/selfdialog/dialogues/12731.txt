"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about all the recent new rules protecting quarterbacks in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hate them. It's changing the integrity of the game too much."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why would you say that? All they are doing is protecting a vulnerable position player."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They're not protecting the quarterback, they're babying him and giving him an unfair advantage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh come on, why would they want to give an unfair advantage to quarterbacks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's pretty obvious, I think.  They NFL likes high-scoring games and high-scoring quarterbacks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're saying they do it to improve ratings because fans want to see games that end 38-30?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's exactly what I'm saying. It's sad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok then, how are the rules giving advantages to quarterbacks?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For one thing, a defensive lineman can no longer rush at the quarterback at full speed for fear he will get a personal foul and maybe even get fined and thrown out of the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that still happens. How do these rules prevent that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You need to see an interview with Deacon Jones. He'll set you straight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You mean the guy who played for the Rams? Wasn't he known as a dirty player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a tough player. Of course the guys on the losing end of his rough play are going to call it dirty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, what does he say about all this?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He says we're molly-coddling the quarterbacks. He says they might as well skirts back there because no one is allowed to hit them any more and because of that they have free reign to do anything they want."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what's wrong with that? Why should they get hit so hard?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Because it's part of the game and football is about intimidation and heart as much as it is about scoring. If you punish an opponent enough, they get scared and they give up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why not just make it about who is the better player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Playing rough IS about who is the better overall player, because it takes into account how much drive and determination you have. If you can take a beating and keep on coming, you are a champion and THAT is what football should be about."
