"__DISNEY__ The new Beauty and the Beast movie was so good!"
"__DISNEY__ It really was. I love Emma Watson as Belle. And they did a good job with the other actors, too."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like the music?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, definitely. They did the classic songs so well but I also loved all the new songs. It added it's own flair to the classic movie."
"__DISNEY__ I think my favorite part was when Beast showed Belle the library. It was such a big library, I wish I had one like that!"
"__DISNEY__ I wish I had his castle! And all the people who worked in the castle are so great. I would love to have Lumiere as a friend!"
"__DISNEY__ Lumiere is great, but I love Mrs. Potts and Chip the best. Chip is so cute."
"__DISNEY__ He is cute. I'm really glad they did a live-action remake of it. It was better than I expected."
"__DISNEY__ It was really good! I love the classic, but this one has it's own charms."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. It was a great movie and I'm glad kids get to grow up with their own special version of the movie I loved so much as a kid."
