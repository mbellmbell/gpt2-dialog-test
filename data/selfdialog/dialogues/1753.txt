"__MUSIC__ Are you a fan of Frank Ocean?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I don't really like R&B."
"__MUSIC__ I think you should give him a shot."
"__MUSIC__ Why? I said I don't like R&B."
"__MUSIC__ He's not doesn't make the typical kind of R&B music you're thinking of though."
"__MUSIC__ Well what kind is it then?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a combination of classic R&B elements but more modernized."
"__MUSIC__ That just sounds like you're describing The Weeknd."
"__MUSIC__ No, The Weeknd is more pop R&B, whereas Frank Ocean combines R&B, soul, and incredible lyrics and storytelling."
"__MUSIC__ I see. I'm still not really convinced."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't you say you value meaning and lyrical ability in music, rather than just what sounds good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but if I don't like the genre, then I can't enjoy the music."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. However, I'm telling you that Frank Ocean makes music in a genre that you've never even heard before."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I could give him a listen, but I don't have high expectations."
"__MUSIC__ Good. Then you'll probably be blown away."
"__MUSIC__ What song should I listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ You have to listen to a whole album to get the full effect. His albums have strong themes and each song leads into the next one."
"__MUSIC__ Well what's his best album?"
"__MUSIC__ He has two studio albums. One is called Channel Orange and the other is called Blonde. Pick one of those and you are set."
"__MUSIC__ Channel Orange sounds interesting. I'll try that first."
