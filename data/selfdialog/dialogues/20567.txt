"__MOVIES__ I think I am getting tired of comic book movies."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ There are just far too many movies based on comic books coming out."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't disagree.  There are a lot of comic book movies coming out."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think that the superhero bubble will burst soon?"
"__MOVIES__ I think people may become a bit tired of them, but I wouldn't go that far."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ Superhero films and television shows have been around for decades."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but the previous movies and television shows haven't been as popular as they are now."
"__MOVIES__ That is true."
"__MOVIES__ Just as we saw vampire-influenced movies lose popularity, you will see superhero movies lose popularity."
"__MOVIES__ I look at the comic book movie genre just as I do the action movie genre, sci-fi genre, or crime genre."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Every year we have action movies or cop dramas that come out, yet there is still an audience for those movies.  People have not abandoned those genres."
"__MOVIES__ I see what you are saying."
"__MOVIES__ Also, I think if you create these movies right, you can constantly create fresh material."
"__MOVIES__ Yes.  The worlds of the comic books are definitely filled with a lot of different stories that cover a lot of subject matter."
"__MOVIES__ You can create a spy drama, a movie about Norse gods, greek gods, horror.  The list goes on."
"__MOVIES__ I think it will take the right directors and writers that are willing to take risks with the story."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  You have to change it up or it can certainly grow stale."
