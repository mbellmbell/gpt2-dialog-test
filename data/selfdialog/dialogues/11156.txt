"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you think the Carolina Panthers will do this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Fairly decent.  I doubt they will return to the Super Bowl again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How important is Cam Newton to the team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is very important.  He needs to cut down on turnovers and mistakes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about his receivers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are fair.  His best passing option is going to his tight end Greg Olsen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the rookies will help out?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They should. Christian McCaffrey should help at back and receiver.  He seems really fast."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he seems like he could play multiple positions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly.  Also with Cam Newton being so mobile they might run the option at times."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think the option would work?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It doesn't seem to at times in the NFL. Miami tried it some in the past."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they had hit and miss success with the wildcat system."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ However, I think Cam Newton is a bigger and faster player than what other teams have had when using it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the Panthers defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Luke Kuechly is definitely the best or one of the best linebackers in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes he definitely covers a lot of ground on defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Everything centers around his play. However he needs help in the secondary."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the secondary plays well do you think they can return to the Super Bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not.  When they went to the Super Bowl two years ago I think they were just having really good luck in a lot of games."
