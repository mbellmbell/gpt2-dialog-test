"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Hinder?"
"__MUSIC__ No who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They are a rock group, they have that sing Lips of an Angel."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, now I know who your talking about. Its been awhile since I heard that band."
"__MUSIC__ I actually went to a concert of theirs one time."
"__MUSIC__ How was it?"
"__MUSIC__ It was really good, they actually sound great live."
"__MUSIC__ Thats cool, did you get any autographs?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they didn't do a signing."
"__MUSIC__ That sucks, I like to collect signatures."
"__MUSIC__ One thing that was funny though was that the band collected bras."
"__MUSIC__ What? Bras?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I'm not even making this up."
"__MUSIC__ You can't be serious?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I am. I guess that is a thing, for Hinder fans to throw their bras onto the stage."
"__MUSIC__ Thats kind of weird."
"__MUSIC__ They would hang them off their instruments to the point that they were completely cover."
"__MUSIC__ That is hilarious. I wish I could have seen what that looked like."
"__MUSIC__ A girl I was with even took her bra off and threw it on stage."
"__MUSIC__ No way. Now I really wish I was there."
