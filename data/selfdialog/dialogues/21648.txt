"__DISNEY__ Okay so classic Disney movies. How about Cinderella?"
"__DISNEY__ That was a good one. The music was catchy."
"__DISNEY__ It was. Although it was a bit of a girl movie."
"__DISNEY__ No kidding. A girl is forbidden from going out by her step mom - total teen drama, right?"
"__DISNEY__ My thoughts exactly. The step mom probably wasn't even that evil."
"__DISNEY__ No, that was just Cinderella's take on it."
"__DISNEY__ And there's no way Prince Charming was that charming."
"__DISNEY__ I wouldn't think so. Most prices are sort of spoilt and ill adjusted."
"__DISNEY__ Well, it's definitely a young woman's fantasy. Right down to the Fairy God Mother."
"__DISNEY__ Who's skilled at producing ball gowns! For sure."
