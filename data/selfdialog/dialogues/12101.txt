"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You pumped about less penalties for celebrations?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah. It'll be way better. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it's the best way forward. I always feel bad when they throw penalties just for celebrating."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. It's ridiculous."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And you know Marshawn's still going to get a penalty for some sort of celebration."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure. That will be worth it, though. I'm glad he's back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me, too. Oakland may just devastate folks this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so, at least."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I'd like to see them succeed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think Dak will look like this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys? He'll be good. Really good. Now. As good as last year? I'm not sure. He'll have a harder time, that's for sure."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I think he'll do good. Just not as successful. It's just so much harder once defenders really start looking at the tape."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. And also. Now he's the man. It's just different for the players. To try to bring down the big man. You know, just a bigger famous QB to talk about you sacking?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup. It's good times, ahead. Still though, I don't think the Cowboys go deep in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Who do you have in the Superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man. Hate to say it. Because I hate them. Patriots. Maybe Patriots and Tampa."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tampa? Man, I think you're dreaming a little now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe, but that's what I'd like to see."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me. I want bang-bang. Maybe Steelers and Oakland. That would be good."
