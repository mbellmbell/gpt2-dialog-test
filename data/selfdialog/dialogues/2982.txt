"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of the musical group, Gojira?"
"__MUSIC__ No. What kind of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ They are a relatively new metal band."
"__MUSIC__ What type of metal?"
"__MUSIC__ You could say they are somewhat progressive and possibly post-metal. They have a unique sound."
"__MUSIC__ Who are they similar too?"
"__MUSIC__ I would say they are somewhat similar to Meshuggah and Mudvayne."
"__MUSIC__ They're like Meshuggah? Are they 'djent' sounding?"
"__MUSIC__ No I wouldn't put them in that category."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like they might be good. Why are they called Gojira?"
"__MUSIC__ Gojira is the original japanese name for Godzilla. Their music talks about saving the earth and Godzilla (or Gojira) was a force to protect the Earth."
"__MUSIC__ That's kind of cool. Are they a good band?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they are one of the best sounding bands, although they don't get to technical with virtuoso riffs and such. The lead singer has a very powerful voice for metal."
"__MUSIC__ Are they an American group or foreign?"
"__MUSIC__ They are actually from France. You would never know that just from listening to them, though."
"__MUSIC__ A French metal band? That's interesting."
"__MUSIC__ I think metal has become pretty big in France as of late, although I don't now of any other really good French bands personally."
"__MUSIC__ I don't either. Which album do you think I should listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I would probably start off with 'The Way of All Flesh.'"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds pretty intense. I'll have to check it out."
