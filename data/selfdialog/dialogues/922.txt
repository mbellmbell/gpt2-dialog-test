"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Taylor Swift is putting her music back on Spotify and other streaming services?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I am excited."
"__MUSIC__ I don't really listen to Taylor Swift a lot but a lot of my friends like her."
"__MUSIC__ I went to a party this weekend and the host was playing a bunch of Taylor Swift to celebrate her being back on Spotify."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds like a strange party. Most of the parties I go to play pop or hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, some of her music is more upbeat but her older stuff is sad country songs."
"__MUSIC__ I like some of her older stuff like 'Tim McGraw' and 'Back to December'. I just don't want to listen to it at a party though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I agree, but I wasn't in control of the music."
"__MUSIC__ What would you have played if you got to pick?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe a summer anthems playlist with some Calvin Harris, Nicki Minaj, Chance the Rapper, stuff like that."
"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Lorde song, 'Green Light'?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't yet, but I liked 'Tennis Courts' and 'Royals' so maybe I should look into it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you should definitely check it out. She released a whole new album this year called Melodrama."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't heard of it yet. Is that the only single so far?"
"__MUSIC__ I think she released a second single from the album, but I don't know the name."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. Is she from Ireland?"
"__MUSIC__ No, she's from New Zealand. Her real name is Ella."
"__MUSIC__ That's a pretty name."
"__MUSIC__ She's really young too. Only 20."
"__MUSIC__ Wow. Does that mean she was born in 96?"
