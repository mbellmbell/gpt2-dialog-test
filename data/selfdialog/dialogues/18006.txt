"__MOVIES__ Hey, you've seen any good movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ At the theater?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, something recent."
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know we don't get out to the movies much--mainly Netflix and that sort of thing."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean--the comfort of home and not paying 10 bucks for popcorn and a small soda."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, we did see a movie in a theater a while back that I liked.  I can't think of the name."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what was it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Some little girl genius."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, Gifted, that was a good movie; we saw it, too."
"__MOVIES__ The little girl was really good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and so was Chris Evans."
"__MOVIES__ I don't even know who that is."
"__MOVIES__ He was the uncle that raised her."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, he was good, too.  My trouble with most movies these days is they are either big comic action things or animated."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I don't like those either, although it is amazing what they do with animation now."
"__MOVIES__ And all the big stars do the narration, so when I do see one, I actually usually enjoy it, but I don't seek them out."
"__MOVIES__ Did you consider going to Circle, the new Tom Hanks movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually I did, but then the reviews weren't that good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I felt the same way, although the subject matter seemed interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I like Hanks, always think of Forrest Gump--talk about dating myself.  Well, catch you later."
