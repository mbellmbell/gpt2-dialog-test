"__MUSIC__ Hey, what's on your mind, mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, I was just thinking about the Guardians of the Galaxy soundtrack."
"__MUSIC__ Like, the instrumental music or the 70s music?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, definitely the 70s music."
"__MUSIC__ It's cool how they brought all that music back and made people listen to it again."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was really a hit. But I was actually thinking about the second movie."
"__MUSIC__ The second one? ...Yeah, I guess it had 70s music in it too."
"__MUSIC__ But you had to think about it, right? I wonder why those songs didn't catch on as much as the first mix did."
"__MUSIC__ I think the first mix had more iconic songs, like 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough.'"
"__MUSIC__ And I guess 'Cherry Bomb' is a pretty well known song as well."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I could sit here for ages and not name one song from the newest one."
"__MUSIC__ I guess there was the element of surprise for the first one, too. No one knew what to expect."
"__MUSIC__ Ugh, but the music in the first one was just so good. 'Hooked on a Feeling!'"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, I love the 'ooga chakas' at the beginning of that one."
"__MUSIC__ It's so weird, but it's so fun."
"__MUSIC__ 'Pina Colada' also has a fun twist at the end."
"__MUSIC__ And I think the fun element is what made it work so well. People just wanted to enjoy the film, and the music was part of that."
"__MUSIC__ It was like nostalgia for something most of us never actually experienced, because we were too young."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, exactly. Now I kinda wanna listen to that soundtrack again!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm down for it. How about 'Come and Get Your Love'?"
