"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ EDM for sure"
"__MUSIC__ Don't you think EDM is dying now?"
"__MUSIC__ No, I think that it's changing now though"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well Electronic dance music has been all the hype. Do you agree?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it used to be, at clubs and parties."
"__MUSIC__ Right, it's mostly party music. But EDM has been incorporated into pop music now, and is less 'dancy.'"
"__MUSIC__ Can you give me an example?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Big DJ's like Tiesto, Calvin Harris, don't make it on the radio anymore. It's mostly pop, progressive, house music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh like Tropical house, or Justin bieber's stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ Really anything on the radio uses a more mellow EDM. So I wouldn't say EDM has died but really is just changing"
"__MUSIC__ Interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Another point of interest is, every popular song has a drop now, and that's what EDM created."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. Drops are pretty important to generating excitment."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but the drops tend to me more mellow now, like break down sections."
"__MUSIC__ It's interesting how music evolves."
"__MUSIC__ We're just here for the ride my friend."
"__MUSIC__ Where do you think the EDM's going?"
"__MUSIC__ We'll have to wait and see!"
