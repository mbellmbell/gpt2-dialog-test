"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite band of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure, but it would definitely be a classic rock band."
"__MUSIC__ I remember that you would always have the radio tuned to the classic rock station in Chicago."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess my overall favorite would be Pink Floyd."
"__MUSIC__ Did you ever get to see them in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ I saw them when Roger Waters played with them for that one concert in London."
"__MUSIC__ Dude, that's a like a bucket-list kind of deal."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was over there for university and happened to fall into it."
"__MUSIC__ Was it expensive?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, like almost an entire month's rent check, but it was worth it."
"__MUSIC__ Remember how they would always play Pink Floyd at the laser light show at the planetarium?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but it was always from The Wall or Dark Side of the Moon."
"__MUSIC__ So, those are like their best albums!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but the rest of their catalogue is under-appreciated."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Animals would easily match up to those two."
"__MUSIC__ It's tonally kinda trippy and definitely sets up the Wall, which was released like a year or two later."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Pigs on the Wing is definitely on the trippier end of the spectrum."
"__MUSIC__ I actually still have the vinyl."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I ever did, I didn't into them until CDs existed."
