"__DISNEY__ Did you see that they're doing a live-action remake of The Lion King?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow! I wonder how they're going to manage that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, they did The Jungle Book with CGI, so I guess they'll use the same techniques."
"__DISNEY__ My kids really love that movie, although the part where Simba's dad dies is pretty sad."
"__DISNEY__ I know! Never mind my kids, that had me crying in the theater."
"__DISNEY__ Still, I think that's part of the movie's enduring appeal."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I think it helps kids deal with the idea that death is part of the circle of life."
"__DISNEY__ It's also a hilarious movie, though. I hope the remake keeps the humor!"
"__DISNEY__ And the romance between Simba and Nala. It's so sweet!"
"__DISNEY__ I'm looking forward to seeing this one when it comes out."
