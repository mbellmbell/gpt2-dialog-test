"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Taylor Swift?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think she's had an album out for a while, has she?"
"__MUSIC__ No, she sorta disappeared from the scene last year?"
"__MUSIC__ What happened to her?"
"__MUSIC__ Nobody is really sure, but after that last feud with Kanye West, she was gone."
"__MUSIC__ Perhaps the pressure of the feud got to her."
"__MUSIC__ Could be, because that video he did with all of those celebrities in bed with him, including her, went pretty viral."
"__MUSIC__ I'm surprised no one sued Kanye over that."
"__MUSIC__ I think Kanye West would make more money from a lawsuit than if he were left alone."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know if that guy is a genius, but he sure knows how to manipulate."
"__MUSIC__ He's another one that hasn't put out any music in a while."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, what's with these musicians lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I know, it's like they stopped making music because being socialites is their job now."
"__MUSIC__ It's sad because when I was a kid, music was so important to everyone."
"__MUSIC__ Seriously, what is the soundtrack of the current generation?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess anyone can be a musician thanks to YouTube and platforms like that."
"__MUSIC__ I hear that's how Justin Bieber got his start, as well as Rebecca Black."
"__MUSIC__ Those are another two that disappeared from the face of the earth!"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe that same thing will happen to Ariana Grande after the incident at her concert a couple of weeks ago."
"__MUSIC__ That was horrible, but I hope it doesn't stop her from making more music."
