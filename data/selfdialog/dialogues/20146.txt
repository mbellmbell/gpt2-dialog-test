"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite genre of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I love a good gangster movie.  Do you like those as well?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I love a good mob movie.  What's your favorite mob movie them?"
"__MOVIES__ Well how can you go against The Godfather?"
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  Part 1 or Part 2 though?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I am an original, so I will stick with Part 1.  How about you?"
"__MOVIES__ I like both really, that's one heck of an evening for sure."
"__MOVIES__ When you look at the cast list for those movies, it is absolutely amazing.  Did you have a favorite performance?"
"__MOVIES__ Well the obvious answer would be Al Pacino, but I was always partial to the hotheaded Sonny, played brilliantly by James Caan."
"__MOVIES__ He certainly did go out in a spectacular way.  My favorite was Mr. Cool - Robert Duvall as Tom Hayden."
"__MOVIES__ Geez, I almost forgot about him and how great he was in that movie.   How about the Scorsese mob movies, you a fan of those?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh absolutely, more so of GoodFellas though.  Ray Liotta was great in that movie, and Joe Pesci was unforgettable."
"__MOVIES__ Not a big fan though of Casino - how come?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I did enjoy Casino a lot.  I just found the Sharon Stone/James Woods storyline to be annoying."
"__MOVIES__ I do agree with that.  Can you believe she won an Oscar for that role?"
"__MOVIES__ Well her performance was fine I guess, it was just the character that so damn annoying."
"__MOVIES__ You do have a point there.  But once again Joe Pesci ruled the day."
"__MOVIES__ And nobody dies quite like Joe Pesci in a good mob movie.  Remember when he go it in the back of the head in GoodFellas?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, that was quite startling when I first saw it.  But beaten with baseball bats and buried in a cornfield in Casino was pretty good too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I forgotten about that.  That was great, but I think I had blocked it out of my mind from seeing Pesci in his tidy whities.  LOL"
