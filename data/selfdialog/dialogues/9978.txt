"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you heard Big Sean's new album?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The one that came out this year? Yeah."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I personally think it's his best work."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I agree. I'm surprised it doesn't get more radio play."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It seems to be like that with certain rap artists."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, they can make the best music and still get no radio play."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ If the song doesn't have a hook it usually won't get played."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ True, a lot of his stuff doesn't really fit the radio song structure."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, It's just a lot of clever rapping with very little singing parts."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ At least no one can say he's selling out."
