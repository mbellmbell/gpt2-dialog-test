"__MOVIES__ I had no idea that Split was connected to Unbreakable."
"__MOVIES__ Me either. I was so confused when Bruce Willis showed up at the end."
"__MOVIES__ I was so confused when Kevin actually turned into The Beast."
"__MOVIES__ I know. I was not expecting the movie to be a supervillian movie at all."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was just going to be a typical scary movie."
"__MOVIES__ Totally, but it did make me want to watch Unbreakable after I saw it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, and did you hear a sequel is coming out called Glass?"
"__MOVIES__ Really? I had no idea."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. It's coming out in 2019."
"__MOVIES__ That's exciting. It has been a while since I have seen Bruce Willis in a movie."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I loved him in The Sixth Sense."
"__MOVIES__ M. Night Shymalan directed The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Split."
"__MOVIES__ Wow. That must be why I love all of those movies so much."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Did you ever see Signs?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've never heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ He directed that movie, too."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's not as highly rated as some of his other films, but I found it very enjoyable."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about a man that has lost his faith after his wife dies, and he has to comes to terms with what he believes when aliens try to takeover earth."
