"__THRILLER__ Do you recommend The Prestige or The Illusionist for a thriller?"
"__THRILLER__ The Prestige."
"__THRILLER__ So they're both about magic."
"__THRILLER__ Right."
"__THRILLER__ Why do you prefer this one?"
"__THRILLER__ It has a surprise twist you most likely won't see coming."
"__THRILLER__ Oooh, nice. Like an M. Night twist?"
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it's pretty devastating and shows a ton of commitment."
"__THRILLER__ Nice! Sounds good."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, The Illusionist isn't bad either, but not really a thriller."
