"__MUSIC__ I am so bored right now!"
"__MUSIC__ Me to, how about we listen to some music?"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds fun, but we should listen to something a little different!"
"__MUSIC__ How about we listen to something old school?"
"__MUSIC__ Remember when we used to love boy bands back in high school?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! The nineties was the best decade ever for boy bands."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, we truly grew up in the golden era of boy band prominence."
"__MUSIC__ I say we should listen to some our favorite nineties boy band songs!"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds like a party to me! Should we start with some Backstreet Boys?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I was kind of thinking NSYNC would be where we start."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds fine to me! Can I choose the song?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, which one do you want to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I love Bye Bye Bye, and This I promise You the best."
"__MUSIC__ Those are both awesome songs, what about Tearin' Up My Heart?"
"__MUSIC__ I had forgot about that one! Either of those songs are fine with me!"
"__MUSIC__ Besides the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, what were some other popular boy bands from the nineties?"
"__MUSIC__ Have you forgot about Hanson and 98 Degrees?"
"__MUSIC__ I have not thought about those groups in such a long time!"
"__MUSIC__ Me either, but it is fun to think back on music we used to love."
"__MUSIC__ I agree, we should do this much more often!"
