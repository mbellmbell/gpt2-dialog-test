"__MOVIES__ Are you kidding me? There's ANOTHER Fast and Furious movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. Just saw the trailer."
"__MOVIES__ How many of these things are they going to make?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha â€” as long as Vin Diesel keeps laughing his way to the bank."
"__MOVIES__ Right. Man. Well, this one at least has the Rock."
"__MOVIES__ You a Dwayne Johnson fan?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, I don't mind if he's in a movie. I don't go out of my way to watch his films, but I don't mind him."
"__MOVIES__ I hear you there. So will you watch Baywatch?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, I heard he's in that too. I actually think that sounds kind of good. Kind of."
"__MOVIES__ Well, good in that campy kind of way, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, totally. These aren't movies you take too seriously."
"__MOVIES__ Right! Action films are fun, cheap entertainment."
"__MOVIES__ Speaking of, apparently there's yet another one of these Transformers movies."
"__MOVIES__ Oh gawd."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there's five of them. Five too many, if you ask me."
"__MOVIES__ I thought the first one was OK."
"__MOVIES__ The first was sort of entertaining, although I'm not entirely sure I understand the message. But boy did that Shia LaBouf go off the deep end."
"__MOVIES__ That made for some interesting headlines for awhile."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, what's with that guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Guess he turned out to be a whole lot more than meets the eye."
