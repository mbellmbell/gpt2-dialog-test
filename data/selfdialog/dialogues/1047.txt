"__MUSIC__ I am looking for a song by Glass Pear, the one they used in vampire diaries I think?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I know what one you are talking about, 'Wild Place' right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes! That is the one, I just love the sound of it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to any of their other music?"
"__MUSIC__ No, maybe I should check some out."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he has a very good sound in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ He's not American is he?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, Welsh I believe?"
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if his songs have been used in any other tv shows."
"__MUSIC__ Probably, they seem to do that with artists that are good, but not well known."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going to look him up, if I like the one song so much, I'm sure I'll like more."
"__MUSIC__ Wouldn't it be cool if he was putting on live shows?"
"__MUSIC__ Yea, but not being main stream, what are the chances he'd come anywhere around us?"
"__MUSIC__ True, but maybe we could find a page or twitter or something to follow so we'll know if he does."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I just googled it, he has a web site."
"__MUSIC__ Is he doing any shows?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not seeing any updates since 2014. That's sad."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe he's working on a whole album or just had a kid or something."
"__MUSIC__ Either way, looks like he has a fair amount of songs here, I'm going to have to give them all a listen"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds good, let me know of any really good ones!"
