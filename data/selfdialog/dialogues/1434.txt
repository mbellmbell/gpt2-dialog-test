"__MUSIC__ I don't like rap."
"__MUSIC__ Why not? There are a lot of great rap songs."
"__MUSIC__ Rap is just a bunch of thugs promoting misogyny and capitalism."
"__MUSIC__ There's certainly a lot of that, especially on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ I heard this song the other day on my way to work, and it has to have been the stupidest song I've ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ What was it?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know who it was by, but the rapper was talking about taking an Uber everywhere."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I think I know what song you're talking about. It's by Madeintyo."
"__MUSIC__ It is idiotic and a prime example of why I think rap is trash."
"__MUSIC__ That song is definitely silly. Especially when he goes 'skrrt skrrt!'"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I laughed really hard and couldn't believe it was a real song."
"__MUSIC__ Not all rap is like that though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah right. If it's not about fast cars, it's about sex or gang fighting."
"__MUSIC__ Rap gets much more complex than that. You'd be surprised what kind of stuff rappers talk about sometimes."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Take Joey Bada$$ for example. He has some really powerful and thoughtful lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't he do that song 'Devastated'? That song is fun but not necessarily meaningful."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but that's his radio hit. You need to listen to some of his other stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, I'll take your word for it."
"__MUSIC__ A lot of people think rap is a monolith but it's really not. I'll send you some links to good rappers."
