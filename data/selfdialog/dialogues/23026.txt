"__DISNEY__ Why do you think so many of the Disney Princess always have a tragic back story?"
"__DISNEY__ Like Belle losing her mom?"
"__DISNEY__ Do not even get me started on her story."
"__DISNEY__ Why not?"
"__DISNEY__ She is kidnapped, then falls in love. It is nuts."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but he changes."
"__DISNEY__ Not enough, he was going to kill her dad."
"__DISNEY__ I think it is a beautiful film."
"__DISNEY__ It is better than the girl from Tangled feeling bad for her actual kidnapper."
"__DISNEY__ Ok, that is true that was a bit out there."
