"__MUSIC__ Hey J.D did you think about that concert invite I sent?"
"__MUSIC__ Was that the Hot Chip invite on Facebook?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man exactly!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a big fan of Hot Chip but there is no space to dance at the Mint venue."
"__MUSIC__ I know but we can still see them on the West Coast and that is worth it."
"__MUSIC__ I really only hope they play songs from the Ready for the Floor era."
"__MUSIC__ You always talk about those Hot Chip years like they were the best, I must disagree."
"__MUSIC__ That is when they were at their creative peak, I Feel Better is a legendary tune that they haven't topped."
"__MUSIC__ They've become more dance ready with beats and harmonies, less lyrics."
"__MUSIC__ I miss the lead vocalist being funky and jamming with the soft vocals."
"__MUSIC__ It was all synth back then, it is more organic sound now."
"__MUSIC__ Does Hot Chip have an under card performance?"
"__MUSIC__ I think Crookers might be performing nearby in Downtown."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow Crookers was incredible back in the day!"
"__MUSIC__ I remember those old school raves, that is kind of why I want to go to Hot Chip."
"__MUSIC__ I get that completely, I will get a ticket for both."
"__MUSIC__ Salmon Dance is one of the best remixes ever made!"
"__MUSIC__ I love that track and miss the old times, this show will be for nostalgia's sake."
"__MUSIC__ Let's do it bud, and jam that Crookers and Hot Chip all day!"
"__MUSIC__ Let's do it!"
