"__STAR_WARS__ I really think that they under utilize Princess Leia in all of the Star Wars movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well if she's the only other living relative of Darth Vadar and can wield the Force like Luke and Vadar, shouldn't she be getting Jedi training?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She is in command of things back at the base of operations."
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, they are leaving her back at home while they go fight the battles.  It seems to me like she should be more involved."
"__STAR_WARS__ But she comes up with all of the battle plans and lays everything out."
"__STAR_WARS__ Actually you never see her do that.  Once they start an actual battle plan she is left out of it, other characters go through the plans of attack."
"__STAR_WARS__ She brings all the people to the table, people wouldn't even be there to fight if not for her."
"__STAR_WARS__ I still think they should give her a bigger role, she should be moving things with her mind and flying a ship.  In all of the attack scenes like when they are destroying the Death Stars in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi it's the weird lobster guy who gives all the orders."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think you are underestimating her influence.  I think you see it much more in Force Awakens where she is running the base for the Resistance."
