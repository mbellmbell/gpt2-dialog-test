"__MOVIES__ Is there any movies you'd like to see?"
"__MOVIES__ No new releases come to mind, but I wouldn't mind re-watching an older movie."
"__MOVIES__ What movies would you like to see?"
"__MOVIES__ The other day I watched the original Alien movie. I wouldn't mind watching Alien 2."
"__MOVIES__ There was a Alien 2?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, and an Alien 3 and 4 I think. Of course there was Predator vs. Alien."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that movie kind of old?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, the original Alien movie must be more than ten years old."
"__MOVIES__ I don't really care for movies that are too old, because the special effects are lacking."
"__MOVIES__ Actually the effects in Alien were ahead of their time. I don' think you would be disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ Who stars in that?"
"__MOVIES__ Sigourney Weaver is the main star, but the other actors are less notable."
"__MOVIES__ Has Sigourney Weaver been in any other movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure she has, but Alien is the only movie of hers that I recall for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Where can we watch Alien 2?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure we can watch it on Netflix or Amazon Prime. Do you have either of those?"
"__MOVIES__ I have Amazon Prime, but their selection isn't great so I'm not sure they would have Alien 2."
"__MOVIES__ We can go to my place and watch it on Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Is Alien 2 appropriate for kids?"
"__MOVIES__ Aside from scare sequences (is it sci-fi horror after all) and some cartoonish gore and mild cussing it should be fine."
