"__STAR_WARS__ No way, the new movies are just as canonical as the older stuff."

"__STAR_WARS__ He's not the greatest character, no, but he is canon."
"__STAR_WARS__ 'Not the greatest'? He was so annoying!"

"__STAR_WARS__ But he did have a part to play, and he became an ambassador later."
"__STAR_WARS__ It didn't stop what happened."
"__STAR_WARS__ He did what he could."
