"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What's your opinion on the Broncos?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They are a good team, I like them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but do you think that they have been slipping since Peyton left?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well yeah, Siemmeins might not have been on his caliber but just give him a year or two."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, it can be little hard for a rookie to be good on the spot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's correct, just look at Jameis Winston, he's doing good, but he can be better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, but the Dallas Cowboy got the best of both work, no?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, their Quarterback and Running Back are doing great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah Ezekiel and Prescott carried that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They sure did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but I think that the Broncos can become every good in a few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah no question about that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a good defense, just need to make some play on the run and the throw."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You are talking my mind man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not like they have never made it into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Haha, that reminds me of the Chief."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They always make it into the Playoff but the can't never win a title."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? That's very surprising."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah and they were in the first Super Bowl!"
