"__STAR_WARS__ Too many people don't understand the nature of the Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. Even Disney was buying into the Light vs Dark dichotomy."
"__STAR_WARS__ A Manichean balance is tempting, because it feels intuitively right. You don't have to delve into the Buddhist philosophy that Lucas was getting into."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'd still prefer it if Snoke didn't talk about the Light as if it were a thing. There's the Living Force and the Unifying Force, and there's the Dark Side, which is an imbalance between them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe if Lucas didn't call it a side people would understand better."
"__STAR_WARS__ Possibly.   Did you see The Force Awakens yet?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I have. I consider it to be inferior to the Original Trilogy and the Prequels"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's harsh."
"__STAR_WARS__ The prequels are unfairly maligned. The make more sense if you go back and look at them."
"__STAR_WARS__ Jar Jar Binks will never make sense."
