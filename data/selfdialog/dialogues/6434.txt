"__STAR_WARS__ Are you a big Star Wars fan?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Not really. I've only seen the first one."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think I'm going to watch them before we go to Disney."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh that's a good idea. They're building new Star Wars stuff, right?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but I don't know anything about it."
"__STAR_WARS__ I will watch them with you!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, let's start with the one with Princess Lea in the gold bikini."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a deal!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll bring copies over tonight."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'll make some popcorn!"
