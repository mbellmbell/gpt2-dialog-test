"__STAR_WARS__ What was your top scene with Darth Vader in all of the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I really liked his appearance in Rouge One. That was incredible."
"__STAR_WARS__ He barely had any dialogue in that movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes but we kept hearing about what a powerful user of the dark side of The Force Darth Vader and I feel like his scene in Rogue One finally showed that off."
"__STAR_WARS__ How about your favorite Darth Vader scene from the original trilogy?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You definitely have to go with the icon scene in Empire Strikes Back where he reveals himself to be Luke Skywalker's father. Nothing tops that scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ That was such a good scene. On top of that, it was also right after an emotional lightsaber duel between Vader and Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ Don't forget that Luke also loses his hand in that scene."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like anything about Darth Vader in the prequal movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well technically he wasn't Darth Vader then, he was still Anakin Skywalker. He didn't become Darth Vader until near the end of Revenge of the Sith."
