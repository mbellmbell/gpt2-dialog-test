"__COMEDY__ Have you seen Deadpool yet?"
"__COMEDY__ Not yet.  How was it?"
"__COMEDY__ Pretty darn funny.  A bit crude though."
"__COMEDY__ Well, it's rated R I believe."
"__COMEDY__ Oh yeah, a well-deserved R.  It's violent and full of strong language."
"__COMEDY__ So you're saying I shouldn't take my daughter?"
"__COMEDY__ Of course not.  She's got another ten years before she should see it."
"__COMEDY__ I don't think I can wait that long."
"__COMEDY__ Want to borrow my copy?"
"__COMEDY__ Sure.  Something for family movie night, eh?"
