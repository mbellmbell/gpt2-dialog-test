"__MUSIC__ Why do you think humans like music so much?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Isn't it weird how the whole world likes music? It's like it's in our blood."
"__MUSIC__ Well when you think about it, it has been in our blood for hundreds of thousands of years."
"__MUSIC__ Like when we were tribal?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally. We made instruments thousands of years ago, and tens of thousands of years ago, sang songs together."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. And now literally everyone in the world can sing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it makes a lot of sense from an evolutionary point of view."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think certain people are more musical than others?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. I think it's a mixture of genetics and also exposure as a kid."
"__MUSIC__ So if I'm terrible at singing, is it because of my genes or because I didn't practice?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd say not practicing definitely didn't help. Not sure if you could have become very good though?"
"__MUSIC__ This is an interesting topic. I should write a paper on this."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah researching the history of music would be pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Thinking about different cultures and different instruments is a very curious subject. What differences between people are caused by different musical interests"
"__MUSIC__ That's a good question."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for answering my question and talking about this. Do you mind if I bounce more ideas off of you?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I was just thinking about percussion and music and how they are related."
"__MUSIC__ That's also an interesting question"
