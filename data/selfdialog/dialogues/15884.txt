"__ROCK__ Do you like 90s rock?"
"__ROCK__ Of course, grunge was very influential!"
"__ROCK__ There will never be another band like Nirvana, that's for sure, but Soundgarden was just as good."
"__ROCK__ Shame about Chris Cornell, he had a really powerful voice."
"__ROCK__ He had one of the best voices in rock. He wasn't grunge, but Mike Patton is up there!"
"__ROCK__ I know! He's awesome, but too many people will only know him for Epic and not for his actual variety."
"__ROCK__ Yup, incredible range. He can scream in one song, croon like Frank Sinatra in another, and he's even done an opera album."
"__ROCK__ He's fluent in Italian and always wants to experiment, so that's no surprise."
"__ROCK__ You really should check out Mondo Caine, since that's his opera album."
"__ROCK__ Thank you, I will!"
