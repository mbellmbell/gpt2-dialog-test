"__MUSIC__ I just started listening to Christmas carols again today."
"__MUSIC__ That makes me so excited. That means it's almost time for my favorite holiday season."
"__MUSIC__ Yes it does!"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Christmas carol?"
"__MUSIC__ That's a tough question. I don't know if I could pick one."
"__MUSIC__ Just try your best. It doesn't have to be your absolute favorite, maybe just one you really like."
"__MUSIC__ I really like 'The First Noel.'"
"__MUSIC__ What a great choice!"
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Christmas carol?"
"__MUSIC__ I love 'Sleigh Bells'?"
"__MUSIC__ That's an interesting answer. I don't know anyone else whose favorite Christmas carol is that one."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I used to play it all the time when I used to play my piano for the people in the nursing home."
"__MUSIC__ That's just such a nice story. How long have you played the piano?"
"__MUSIC__ Since I was twelve. My mom randomly decided to buy a piano one day and I've been playing ever since."
"__MUSIC__ I wish I knew how to play an instrument."
"__MUSIC__ It's never too late."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. What instrument do you think is easiest to learn?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not really sure. They all have some mighty challenges."
"__MUSIC__ I think I'd most want to learn how to play the guitar."
"__MUSIC__ Then you should learn how to play it! It's a skill you'll have forever."
