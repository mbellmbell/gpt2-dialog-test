"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Disturbed Sounds of Silence."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, that was amazing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it even surpassed the original."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  I didn't know he could sing like that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he's a classically trained singer."
"__MUSIC__ Well it sounded great."
"__MUSIC__ How often does a song surpass the original?"
"__MUSIC__ Not often.  Especially since Simon and Garfunkel were great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah one of the best songs either way."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  Off topic but ever notice that song sounds like the plot of Harry Potter?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  I saw a youtube video about that."
"__MUSIC__ I know it's super creepy now close it matches."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me about it.  It's almost a perfect analog for the Snape and Harry relationship."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, either way.  But Disturbed was much deeper."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I like the energy in it."
"__MUSIC__ It was like bam!  Vibrato in the high notes and everything."
"__MUSIC__ Just goes to show you never judge someone."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, who would have though Disturbed has the best voice in rock."
"__MUSIC__ I mean I know they are good."
"__MUSIC__ But who expected the classic music chops."
