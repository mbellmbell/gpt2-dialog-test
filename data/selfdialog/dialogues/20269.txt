"__MOVIES__ Do you want to go see the new movie Baby Driver? It's getting great reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't heard of that. What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It looks to be about a getaway driver and it has lots of exciting action well edited to music, kind of like a musical action-movie."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds weird, why do you want to see it?"
"__MOVIES__ The main reason is that Edgar Wright directed it. He's one of my favorites and I am hearing this is his masterpiece."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting, what was his last movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Funny story - he was supposed to direct Ant-Man for Marvel but there ended up being creative differences and he left the project."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, sounds like there was some drama behind the scenes. I liked Ant-Man a lot so I wonder how it would have been different with Edgar Wright."
"__MOVIES__ The good thing about Edgar Wright movies is you know a lot of work went into each shot. He really loves the craft of film making."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I'll think about seeing Baby Driver. Personally I was leaning towards seeing Despicable Me 3."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I feel like we should support original movies instead of endless sequels all the time."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right, but I just think Steve Carrell is so funny in those movies. Plus you have to love the minions."
"__MOVIES__ I feel like we might have too different of tastes to find a movie to agree on. I hesitate to ask what your feelings about the Emoji movie are."
"__MOVIES__ Oh man, they made an Emoji movie? That is awesome!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh dear, I had a bad feeling about that. Don't you have any respect for true film and the art of cinema?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha, I was just pulling your leg by feigning excitement about the Emoji movie. I would never actually see that."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, you had me going there. Well what else is playing that you might like to see?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm always up for a new Pixar movie and I heard Cars 3 was out."
"__MOVIES__ I guess I can't convince you to avoid the sequels so Pixar might be as good a compromise as any for us."
"__MOVIES__ Great, I will get us two tickets. Hopefully we will get to see a preview of that hilarious Emoji movie before the show."
