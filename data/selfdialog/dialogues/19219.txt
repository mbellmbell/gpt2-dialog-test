"__MOVIES__ What would you say is the ultimate date movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I guess it depends what you mean by 'date'."
"__MOVIES__ OK, how about a first date?"
"__MOVIES__ For a first date, I'd say you want to pick something exciting and interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Why are those the attributes you'd pick?"
"__MOVIES__ It gives you something to talk about afterwards, and the excitement of the movie mirrors the excitement of getting to know someone romantically."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense. So, what would be some examples."
"__MOVIES__ I think a perfect one would be something like Jurassic Park movies."
"__MOVIES__ How about for a third of fourth date?"
"__MOVIES__ Now I think you want something like a Romantic Comedy. Sleepless in Seattle type stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Man, you're old if your go-to Romantic Comedy is Sleepless in Seattle!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha, you got me! I grew up during the era of Meg Ryan and Juilia Roberts and Sandra Bullock doing Rom Coms."
"__MOVIES__ I can see why you'd want to pick a movie like that for a date, but those are always a tough watch for me."
"__MOVIES__ You don't find them charming and romantic?"
"__MOVIES__ Mostly just boring and silly."
"__MOVIES__ I think a well told love story is kind of heart warming."
"__MOVIES__ I like them when they've got more of an emphasis on the comedy. Something like Wedding Crashers."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that''s a great movie. That'd be a good pick for just about any date."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, Will Ferrell as the dude living at home and crashing funerals was the best."
"__MOVIES__ 'Ma! The Meatloaf!' Haha."
