"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What did you think of the new Fast & the Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Honestly man they need to stop making them."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Why do you say that?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Dude they've already run their course, now the movies are turning into nothing but cgi and b.s. scenes with fast cars!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You have a point. Which movie is your favorite though?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The orginial one! Paul Walker in that first race scene was epic."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You're talking about the one with Ludacris right? When Paul Walker jumps the bridge in his eclipse?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yes, that was probably one of the best racing scenes in any of the Fast movies."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh man I don't know about that. Tokyo Drift had some pretty epic racing scenes too!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Ehh serisouly? That's my least favorite Fast & the Furious movie."
