"__MOVIES__ Hey have you seen that King Arthur movie yet?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I saw it last night and I thought it was not good."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you say that?"
"__MOVIES__ It's definitely a mish mash of elements from other much better medieval fantasies and historical epics."
"__MOVIES__ They just took bits and pieces from other similar movies and combined into this one? Is that what you are saying?"
"__MOVIES__ Do you remember those giant elephants in the Lord of The Rings movies?"
"__MOVIES__ How could I forget them? Especially when Legolas was riding one."
"__MOVIES__ Eric Bana is the same fatherly face of love and heroism he was in Troy. Jude Law has that same calm evil vibe as Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus in Gladiator."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was actually an okay movie."
"__MOVIES__ The whole film played like a montage."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I felt that too."
"__MOVIES__ Some of it wasn't bad, like how it showed Arthur growing up on the streets."
"__MOVIES__ I find amazing how you and I saw the same movie but..."
"__MOVIES__ We both walked away with two different opinions about it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not. We all can't be the same or see the world through one set of eyes."
"__MOVIES__ I guess you're right."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think of the final fight?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought the final confrontation is basically a round of Mortal Kombat but they buggered up the fatality finisher."
"__MOVIES__ Harsh."
