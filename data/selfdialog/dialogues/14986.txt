"__ACTION__ My favorite Christmas movie of all times is 'Die Hard.'"
"__ACTION__ 'Die Hard' isn't a Christmas movie, it's an action-adventure movie."
"__ACTION__ It takes place at Christmas. That makes it a Christmas movie."
"__ACTION__ Fine. Name me one other Christmas movie with guns and explosions in it. If you can do that, I'll admit 'Die Hard' is a Christmas movie."
"__ACTION__ That's too easy. 'Home Alone.' I bet you think of that as a Christmas movie, don't you?"
"__ACTION__ 'Home Alone' is a movie aimed at the entire family. Yes, It's got some action-adventure in it but it's for the entire family."
"__ACTION__ And I think 'Die Hard' is a great movie for the entire family. I think you have a bias against Action-Adventure movies. Don't you want your children to be able to recognize a European scum terrorist/thief?"
"__ACTION__ Honestly, no, that isn't one of my biggest concerns. I love action-adventure movies. I love 'Die Hard.' But 'Die Hard' is Not a Christmas movie."
"__ACTION__ It Takes place at Christmas. That makes it a Christmas movie."
"__ACTION__ You're weird!"
