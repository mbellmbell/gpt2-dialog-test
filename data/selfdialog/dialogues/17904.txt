"__MOVIES__ Did you see Get Out?"
"__MOVIES__ I did, yes! Did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I was surprised by how thought-provoking the film is."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. I was fascinated by how Jordan Peele used the trappings of traditional horror films to comment on race relations."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that's an interesting take on it. What are you referring to?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, for instance, the film uses setting to establish a sense of isolation."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the couple drive a long way away from familiar territory to visit the girl's parents, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. But how does that comment on race?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, it's not as direct as that. A rural or isolated setting is fairly common in horror films, of course, but it's the fact that the movie moves from the multicultural urban environment to a more homogeneous rural one."
"__MOVIES__ So, what you're saying is that the setting sets us up to expect horror and we get a comment on race instead?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's both. It sets us up to expect certain things like a threat and then provides a twist on that threat."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I think I follow. Do you think any other horror films comment on race?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the Danish movie The Celebration deals a bit with race."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen it. Is it good?"
"__MOVIES__ It's excellent. It's very much in the tradition of Scandinavian psychological horror."
"__MOVIES__ How does it deal with race?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, this one woman has married a British man and he's black. Her family doesn't seem to approve, but everything's unstated until alcohol is involved."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds really good. Is it a recent film?"
"__MOVIES__ Kind of. I think it came out in the last fifteen years or so. I can't remember."
