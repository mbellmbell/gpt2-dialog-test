"__FASHION__ Did you see what she was wearing yesterday?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, it was really tacky, who wears a skirt with shoes like those?"
"__FASHION__ I know, I would never in a million years expect her to wear something like that."
"__FASHION__ I think she believes she is setting some type of trend."
"__FASHION__ It is only a trend if others think it looks good or it starts to become popular."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, It at least as to have something that pops."
"__FASHION__ I know, her stuff was just all over the place.  Nothing matched and it just didn't make sense."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I was really confused, I thought she was wearing an outfit for a play or something, I didn't realize it was suppose to be an every outfit."
"__FASHION__ Maybe we should go up and ask her what she was thinking?"
"__FASHION__ No that would be really rude."
"__FASHION__ I don't mean just coming out and asking, I mean like saying hey I like your shoes and skirt and see what she says."
"__FASHION__ You mean like hoping she will talk about why she was wearing that combination or something like that?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, plus it will be an ice breaker and maybe we can ask her about it more."
"__FASHION__ Yeah good point, maybe she will explain why she was wearing it and then it would make sense."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, plus I liked her shoes.  I think they were Lou Vitton's."
"__FASHION__ Yeah they were nice, just not with that skirt."
"__FASHION__ I mean her clothes are generally really pretty, but the hot pink and dark green combo, just do not work."
"__FASHION__ Yeah, I think the color choice was extremely poor taste."
"__FASHION__ Maybe if the skirt was a bluish color it would have brought them all together?"
"__FASHION__ Yeah, but I also think the shoes should have been a neutral or bright color, instead of the dark color."
