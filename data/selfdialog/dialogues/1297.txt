"__MUSIC__ Hey, what are you doing?"
"__MUSIC__ I am trying to find a good Christian song."
"__MUSIC__ Why are you looking for that kind of song?"
"__MUSIC__ I am going to sing a song at church in a few weeks and I would like to find something new."
"__MUSIC__ Oh that sounds cool. What artists are you looking at right now?"
"__MUSIC__ Right now I am searching Mercy Me and Chris Tomlin songs."
"__MUSIC__ Well you certainly can't go wrong with I Can Only Imagine from Mercy Me. That one is always good."
"__MUSIC__ Yes I love that one. I am also looking at their song called How Great Is Your Love."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have heard that one before. What songs are you looking at for Chris Tomlin?"
"__MUSIC__ Whom Shall I Fear and Indescribable are at the top of the list right now."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you know if you want to go with one of his songs you should consider his version of Amazing Grace."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes I forgot about that one. That is the best song ever!"
"__MUSIC__ You know there is also this new girl Lauren Diagle who has some really great Christian songs out right now."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have ever heard of her. What are some of her songs?"
"__MUSIC__ How Can It Be, Come Alive, I Am Yours, and also one of her best is Trust In You."
"__MUSIC__ I think I have heard the Trust In You song before but I just didn't know who sang it."
"__MUSIC__ It is really great. I bet you could do it really well."
"__MUSIC__ I will definitely have to put that song on the list."
"__MUSIC__ Well you can't go wrong with any of your choices."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks. I think I am leaning towards either Trust In You or Amazing Grace."
