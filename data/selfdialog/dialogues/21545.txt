"__DISNEY__ Have you seen that movie Big Hero 6?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it was actually really good."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, I didn't expect it to be good from the trailer."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't expect it to be good either, I thought it was over-hyped."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah same here, but it actually made me sad!"
"__DISNEY__ I know right, when the robot sacrificed himself for the boy...so sad."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but in the end, the robot was saved by the memory card thing."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, uugh I hate how his brother died in the beginning."
"__DISNEY__ I thought it was kind of funny..."
"__DISNEY__ Your sick!"
