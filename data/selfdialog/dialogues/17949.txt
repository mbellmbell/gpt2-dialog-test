"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you want to take the kids to see a movie tonight?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that'd be fun, what's out?"
"__MOVIES__ There's a few movies out they might like, Beauty and the Beast, The Boss Baby, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid."
"__MOVIES__ I'm not going to see Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, what about the other two?"
"__MOVIES__ Which one do you think they'd like more?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably The Boss Baby."
"__MOVIES__ Can't we take them to see Guardians of the Galaxy or something?"
"__MOVIES__ No, they're too young for that."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, The Boss baby it is."
"__MOVIES__ Great, I think they'll really like it."
"__MOVIES__ At least someone will."
"__MOVIES__ I'm sure you'll like it too, Alec Baldwin voices the baby."
"__MOVIES__ I do like him in 30 rock."
"__MOVIES__ See, you'll probably like it more than the kids."
"__MOVIES__ I doubt that, but I am interested now."
"__MOVIES__ Great, what time do you get off work?"
"__MOVIES__ I'll be home around 5."
"__MOVIES__ Ok, we'll go to the 7 o'clock showing in town."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds good, see you when I get home."
