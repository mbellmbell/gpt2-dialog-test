"__DISNEY__ Every single time I see a deer, I think of Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ Oh I know what you mean!"
"__DISNEY__ Disney movies like Bambi probably inspired much of my love for the outdoors."
"__DISNEY__ I know. It's so easy to get attached to the characters."
"__DISNEY__ And there's usually a good lesson for kids in the movies as well."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, Bambi makes it out in the world even without its mom."
"__DISNEY__ It is really sad when the mother deer dies."
"__DISNEY__ Death is just part of life, I guess."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good point. Kind of heavy for kids though."
"__DISNEY__ But it's a cute movie all the same."
