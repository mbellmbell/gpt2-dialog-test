"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the Cardinals are the best NFL team."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Their coach is also Bruce Arians, and hes amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think Bruce is really cool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you agree with me?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, I wouldn't say having a cool coach makes them the best team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, they have a lot of other good players as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah maybe. I just think they were a better team when they had Kurt Warner."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I can understand that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really are a great team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they will make the playoffs this year?"
