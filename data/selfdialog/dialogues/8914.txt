"__BEATLES__ Do you like the song 'Yellow Submarine'?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, it's one of my favorite songs by the Beatles. It was on the Revolver album."
"__BEATLES__ Did you know that Paul McCartney wrote it as a children's song?"
"__BEATLES__ Really? There's no hidden meaning in it like some other Beatles songs?"
"__BEATLES__ Nope. Paul was just trying to write a song for Ringo Starr to sing, and this is what he came up with. I guess John Lennon helped out a little."
"__BEATLES__ Wow. I guess people can make lyrics mean anything they want! What other songs were on that album?"
"__BEATLES__ Let's see...it was released in 1966, so probably Eleanor Rigby and She Said She Said."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, right. Those were great songs as well."
"__BEATLES__ Wasn't the Revolver album the last album the Beatles recorded before they stopped any live performances?"
"__BEATLES__ Yes, I think so. It was also the one where they included both psychedelic music and Indian music. Sort of an odd combination."
