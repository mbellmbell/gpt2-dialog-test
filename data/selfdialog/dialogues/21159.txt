"__THRILLER__ So would you classify it as a comedy?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I wouldn't say it was a comedy. It was more so subliminal jokes."
"__THRILLER__ Oh, I see. Is it scary enough that I need a friend with me?"
"__THRILLER__ No, it's not that bad at all."
"__THRILLER__ Ok, I think I'm going to check it out."
"__THRILLER__ You should! I wactually watched it twice."
"__THRILLER__ Why did you watch it twice? It was that good?"
"__THRILLER__ I just kept reading that you pick up on more of the subliminal messages after you watch it a second time."
"__THRILLER__ Well did you?"
"__THRILLER__ I did! I guess they kind of went over my head at first for some reason."
