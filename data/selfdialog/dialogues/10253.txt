"__RAP_HIPHOP__ What do you think about Drake?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't really care for him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why not?  I think he's a pretty good rapper."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He seems talented enough, but he just seems fake."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why do you say that?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ My little sister used to watch a kids show that he was on.  Now he's trying to come out all hard."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, so it kills the vibes."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly.  I just see him as a guy on a kid's show."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wonder how many of his fans from that show listen to him now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He actually changed his name, so I don't know."
