"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite romantic movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well personally I'm a big fan of The Notebook. I know it's a common one, but that's because it's the best one."
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you that it's pretty good. I think my favorite one has to be PS I love you."
"__MOVIES__ That was all right but it was so sad! It almost made me cry."
"__MOVIES__ Do you watch musical movies often? Things like La La Land?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh absolutely. The two musicals I love more than anything in the world are La La Land and Moulin Rouge."
"__MOVIES__ I forgot about Moulin Rouge. I remember how good Ewan Mcgregor was in that though."
"__MOVIES__ He's an excellent actor. Everything from Star Wars to Big Fish."
"__MOVIES__ Big Fish was an interesting one. I won't say it was my favorite, but certainly interesting."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes those indie type of movies can be really good. Did you ever see American Beauty?"
"__MOVIES__ No but I've heard it's good. Is it worth watching?"
"__MOVIES__ Kevin Spacey is excellent in the movie. I'd definitely give it a watch if I were you."
"__MOVIES__ I've never seen a Kevin Spacey movie I didn't like up until now, so I will do that for sure."
"__MOVIES__ You've never seen a bad one? Even Kpax or Superman Returns?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay I actually liked Kpax. It was kind of like The Usual Suspects, with aliens."
"__MOVIES__ I can see that. But you can't deny that Superman Returns had the worst plot of any Superman movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give you that one. But I'm a big Superman fan in general so I think that gives it a little extra credit."
"__MOVIES__ As far as superhero movies go I guess I've seen worse."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I mean Catwoman with Halle Berry? Hello."
"__MOVIES__ Oh don't even mention that movie to me. I tried to watch it on Netflix the other day and almost threw up it was so bad."
