"__MUSIC__ Are you going to the Bayside concert on Tuesday?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd really like to, but I don't have anyone to go with."
"__MUSIC__ I'm going with a big group! Would you like to come with us?"
"__MUSIC__ I'd love to! Bayside is my favorite band, but I hate going to concerts alone."
"__MUSIC__ I never knew you loved Bayside! Me too! What other bands do you like."
"__MUSIC__ I really like Brand New. They're one of my favorites too."
"__MUSIC__ Did you go to their concert with Modest Mouse last year?"
"__MUSIC__ I did! It was incredible. Both bands are so epic and put on a great show."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Brand New album?"
"__MUSIC__ Mine is Deja Entendu. What's yours?"
"__MUSIC__ I love The Devil and God Are Raging Inside of Me."
"__MUSIC__ That's a great album. I have so many fond memories connected with that band."
"__MUSIC__ I feel the same way about Brand New. And Alkaline Trio!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man, I haven't listened to Alkaline Trio in ages. What are they doing?"
"__MUSIC__ They're on a little break right now because their lead singer Matt Skiba is on tour with Blink 182."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I heard about that. Isn't it messed up how Tom Delonge quit the band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I was bummed to hear about it. But I think Skiba is a great substitute."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I prefer old school Blink 182 anyway."
"__MUSIC__ Same here. All The Small Things is my favorite song."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too!"
