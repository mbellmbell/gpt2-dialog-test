"__DISNEY__ So Moana came out on DVD and I didn't think much of it?"
"__DISNEY__ Really?  Why's that?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, I just didn't think the songs were as catchy as some other movies."
"__DISNEY__ I don't quite agree with you.  They were unique and totally fit in with the movie."
"__DISNEY__ I guess I was just expecting more.  The animation was pretty good though."
"__DISNEY__ I kind of thought Maui was a bit too big though."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  He's supposed to be larger than life."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, maybe it's just the Rock I don't like."
"__DISNEY__ Everyone loves the Rock!"
"__DISNEY__ Everybody but me!"
