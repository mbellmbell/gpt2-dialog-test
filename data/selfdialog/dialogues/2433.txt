"__MUSIC__ Did you hear that Steven Tyler is releasing a Country album?"
"__MUSIC__ No way!"
"__MUSIC__ That's what I heard. I've yet to verify."
"__MUSIC__ That would be so weird."
"__MUSIC__ My thought exactly."
"__MUSIC__ I wish Aerosmith would do another album. Not Country!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm with you. I really like that band."
"__MUSIC__ I liked their ealiest stuff best."
"__MUSIC__ That always seems to be the way with those old rockers."
"__MUSIC__ Although, I did like their foray into Hip Hop."
"__MUSIC__ What?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Walk this Way?"
"__MUSIC__ That wasn't Hip Hop."
"__MUSIC__ Well, not the original."
"__MUSIC__ Did they rerecord it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, how do you not know this."
"__MUSIC__ Must have burried my head in the sand!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they did it with Run DMC."
"__MUSIC__ I remeber those guys."
"__MUSIC__ Weren't the 80's grand!"
