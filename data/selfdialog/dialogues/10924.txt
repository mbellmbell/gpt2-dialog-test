"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really hope that we get to the Super Bowl this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I really want to face the Patriots go avenge what happened in 2015."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That interception is still on my mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the Seahawks had that Super Bowl wrapped up, I cannot believe that they called a pass play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well next time that won't happen, next time we will win."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally agree, we are going to take it if we get back against them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does suck that Marshawn isn't on the team anymore though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I get that he wanted to go home to Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But aren't they moving to Vegas anyway?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but they'll still be in Oakland next season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, that's right, he does still get to play in front of his hometown crowd."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, but I would have loved it if he was the one to run it into the end zone during the rematch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh that would be really good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we should also have a pretty easy road to winning the division too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ As long as we stay relatively healthy we will be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easier said than done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tell me about it, we will have to hope the key guys can stay on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes also hoping for some of the young players to emerge."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am sure some will take the stage."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, well we should definitely hit up a game when you have time."
