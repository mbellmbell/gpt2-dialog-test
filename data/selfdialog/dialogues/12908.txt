"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What teams do you think are going to the NFL playoffs this season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the AFC, at least three of last year's playoff teams are - New England, Pittsburgh and Oakland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, can't argue with that. But who else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ In the AFC South, I an't see Houston repeating as division champions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me neither, that was a fluke last season. The Colts should be better this year, at least a little. That's enough to take a weak division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I am not sure about Kansas City in the AFC West."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they get back. Alex Smith is unspectacular, and I can't see that defense being as good this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The AFC North teams should be better. I could see Baltimore and Cincinnati getting the Wild Card spots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could be, but the AFC East won't get any Wild Cards. Miami got lucky last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They did. So did Detroit in the NFC North."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That they did. I doubt they get back into the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too.But Green Bay should win that division again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed. Chicago is a disaster and Minnesota will be worse without Adrian Peterson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFC East could get three playoff spots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it could. Dallas should win the divison again, and the Giants are good enough to return to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. And Washington should be improved enough to contend for the Wild Card."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If they don't get it, I think Tampa Bay could - assuming they don't beat out the Falcons for the NFC South title."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Jameis Winston look like he will be great, and soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The NFC West is Seattle's to lose."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, and I can't see any Wild Card teams from that division."
