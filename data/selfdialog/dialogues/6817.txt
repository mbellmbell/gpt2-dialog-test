"__STAR_WARS__ How did you like Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I hated it."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really? What about the last scene?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be an exception. That was amazing."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's the only scene you liked?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No. Some of it was pretty good but one thing kept bugging me."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's that?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well aren't there supposed to be a bunch of Bothans?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah I forgot about that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah that's why I didn't like it."
