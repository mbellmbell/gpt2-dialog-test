"__ACTION__ Which of the Mission Impossible movies did you like the most?"
"__ACTION__ Probably Ghost Protocol."
"__ACTION__ Isn't that the one where they were dodging sandstorms in the middle east?"
"__ACTION__ Yup, and he was clinging to the building."
"__ACTION__ That had a really funny line in it, and Simon Pegg is hilarious."
"__ACTION__ Yours?"
"__ACTION__ Mission Impossible 3."
"__ACTION__ Really?? Why that one?"
"__ACTION__ That was one of the best-rated, acted, and written. It just didn't get publicity because it's when Tom Cruise came out as crazy."
"__ACTION__ Oh, right after the couch-jumping scene and Scientology. I'll watch it."
