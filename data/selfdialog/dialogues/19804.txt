"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen Teacher Fight?"
"__MOVIES__ No, but I heard of it. What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well two teachers get into it over something really trivial, and one challenges the other to a fight."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds pretty straight forward, who are the actors?"
"__MOVIES__ Charlie Day and Ice Cube. It's funny because Charlie is scared and tries to get out of it the entire movie."
"__MOVIES__ What does he do to get out of it?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it all started because Charlie ratted out Ice Cube about something that happened to a student, the teacher threatened to fire them both, so charlie told the truth."
"__MOVIES__ That doesn't seem fair."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, it's not, but Ice Cube had his reasons."
"__MOVIES__ So what does Charlie do to escape the fight?"
"__MOVIES__ He tries a few things. He tries bribing a student into saying nothing happened, he calls the police, and he even tries to frame Ice cube by planting drugs in his class."
"__MOVIES__ I'm guessing each of these things ends up making things worse."
"__MOVIES__ Kind of, there are a couple of times where Ice cube admits that he changed his mind, but then because of the new things Charlie did, it's back on."
"__MOVIES__ So what does Charlie do?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he ends up growing a lot through the movie. He realizes he's been pushed around for too long, and it's finally time for him to stand up."
"__MOVIES__ Does he? Or does something stop the fight."
"__MOVIES__ No, he really does. He shows up, and puts up a really good fight."
"__MOVIES__ How?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he's just determined that's all. He gets beat up pretty bad, but he never gives up."
"__MOVIES__ This movie sounds hilariously bad."
