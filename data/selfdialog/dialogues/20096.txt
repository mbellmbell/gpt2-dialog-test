"__MOVIES__ What's your favorite Robin Hood movie?"
"__MOVIES__ That would have to be the 1939 Adventures of Robin Hood with Errol Flynn and Olivia De Havilland."
"__MOVIES__ That's one of the best films ever made, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ in glorious color when most films were still madei n black and white."
"__MOVIES__ Basil Rathbone was a wonderful hissable villain, Sir Guy of Gisbourne."
"__MOVIES__ I hissed a lot at Claude Rains as Prince John too."
"__MOVIES__ You can't beat those two for playing bad guys. They were great adversaries for Flynn's Robin Hood."
"__MOVIES__ And Olivia never looked more beautiful than she did in this film, in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ The music by Korngold is a classic score as well."
"__MOVIES__ The swordfight between Sir Guy and Robin at the end, with the long shadows and terrific choreography, was breathtaking to watch."
"__MOVIES__ Rathbone and Flynn were considered two of the best on-screen fencers in the business, and this battle really showed them off."
"__MOVIES__ And I loved the lighter moments, like the sequence when Robin and Little John 'recruit' Friar Tuck into their band of merry men."
"__MOVIES__ Eugene Pallette played Friar Tuck, and he was an unexpected and wonderful swordsman in his own right."
"__MOVIES__ He was an awesome Tuck."
"__MOVIES__ How does this classic stand against, say, Kevin Costner's Robin Hood."
"__MOVIES__ I will say that Costner did his best to do the legend justice, but dude, he wasn't British, and he didn't have the right accent."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, took me right out of the dream every time he opened his mouth. He sure looked great in the part, at least."
"__MOVIES__ Alan Rickman stole that movie, with the most entertaining, over the top Sheriff you could ever imagine."
"__MOVIES__ I had a lot of fun watching Alan Rickman. He made the movie worth watching, for me."
"__MOVIES__ But I'll always love the Errol Flynn Robin Hood the best."
