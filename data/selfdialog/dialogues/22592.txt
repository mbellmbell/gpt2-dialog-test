"__DISNEY__ Have you been to see the latest, 2017 version of Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ You mean the one with Emma Watson as Beauty and Dan Stevens as the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes that one! I haven't seen it yet have you?"
"__DISNEY__ No, but I really want to."
"__DISNEY__ I want to see how Dan Stevens plays the Beast. I enjoyed him so much in Downton Abbey, and this is a very different role for him!"
"__DISNEY__ I'll say, and it's also a pretty big switch for Emma."
"__DISNEY__ I heard that Emma sings in this movie."
"__DISNEY__ They probably all do, don't you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Maybe, I guess that is likely. I really enjoyed the music of the older version from 1991."
"__DISNEY__ You mean the animated one. Yes, that had an awesome soundtrack. Maybe this one does too."
