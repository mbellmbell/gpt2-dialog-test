"__MOVIES__ What are your thoughts on superhero movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I like them. They're always a fun time."
"__MOVIES__ Personally, I'm getting a little sick of them."
"__MOVIES__ Really? They're all different though - how can you be sick of them?"
"__MOVIES__ They don't really seem that different to me. They all start to blend together."
"__MOVIES__ There have been a lot of superhero movies in the last decade."
"__MOVIES__ For example, I have no recollection of Age of Ultron."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't really care for that one. The fight scene was really boring."
"__MOVIES__ Every movie it just seems like there's a bad guy, they fight him, they win."
"__MOVIES__ It is a little formulaic."
"__MOVIES__ Even some of the recent ones that try to do something unique are the same."
"__MOVIES__ I really enjoyed Wonder Woman, though. Gal Gadot was great."
"__MOVIES__ I appreciate that they're trying to do something different by having a female lead, but I was still bored by it."
"__MOVIES__ Even though I like the movies, something REALLY different would be appreciated."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like what about one where the bad guy wins?"
"__MOVIES__ Or what if the whole time, the bad guy was the good guy?"
"__MOVIES__ Exactly! There aren't a lot of shades of grey when it comes to superhero movies."
"__MOVIES__ That's something they're desperately lacking."
"__MOVIES__ And it can't just be a small analysis by the fans."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, it needs to be at the forefront of the movie."
