"__MOVIES__ So what should I watch with Allisa?"
"__MOVIES__ Who's Allisa?"
"__MOVIES__ It's the girl i told you about."
"__MOVIES__ You told me about... many girls..."
"__MOVIES__ Um, no. I told you about Allisa who's a biochemistry student, and then Heather who's the soccer player, and then Kristen who wants to be a teacher, and..."
"__MOVIES__ Ok. Stop. So Biochem girl. Ok. What do YOU want to watch?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. I'm conflicted. It seems like she would feel uncomfortable with a romantic comedy. It's too early."
"__MOVIES__ It's never too early for a romantic comedy. It's about whether or not she's attracted to you that determines whether or not a romantic comedy is appropriate."
"__MOVIES__ Do you think she's attracted to me?"
"__MOVIES__ How the hell should I know? How did she act when you asked her out? Did she try to flirt with you? Did she check out your junk? Did she give you any idea that she's into you?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea. I know she's into me otherwise she wouldn't have said yes. Right? I just need to pick the right movie. Should scifi work on a first date?"
"__MOVIES__ I'll be honest with you. No movies ever work on the first date."
"__MOVIES__ What?!?! why not?!?!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, let's see. Let us examine what a movie viewing entails. You go and wait at the booth with large clear window with show times listed, and then you stand there like an idiot looking over the numbers trying to think which is a good time. That makes you look really smart--ok, no. Then you pay for the ticket, and then you have to do... what?"
"__MOVIES__ Wait."
"__MOVIES__ That's right wait, and you have to find something to fill that void. What is available around the theater? Do you have it planned out?"
"__MOVIES__ Planning isn't my thing. I think better if I don't plan."
"__MOVIES__ And even if you do find something to do while you wait, then you have to do what once the show time is up? Have to wait in the line again, and get into the theater, buy stuff at the concession stands..."
"__MOVIES__ Which is a ripoff, by the way."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, true, and then you go into the theater, and sit next to each other yet, not looking at each other, but looking at a screen, shoveling food into your mouths. Then you spend a 90 minutes doing that, and you come out. You could've spent that 90 minutes in a meaningful conversation... No wait. you know what? Movie is fine for a first date. Go for it."
