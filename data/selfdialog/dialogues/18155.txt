"__MOVIES__ Hey, did you see the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Not yet, actually. I was thinking about it."
"__MOVIES__ It's actually really great!"
"__MOVIES__ Huh, no kidding? What's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know, it starts off with Wonder Woman's origin and all."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, and then what?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I can't tell you that. You have to watch it yourself!"
"__MOVIES__ Ha, I guess you're right. I'm not usually into superhero films."
"__MOVIES__ Me neither lately, but this one was better than most of them."
"__MOVIES__ That reminds me, are you going to see the new Spiderman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I totally forgot that's coming out soon."
"__MOVIES__ Pretty soon, yeah. I was thinking about seeing it."
"__MOVIES__ I thought you weren't into comic book based movies though?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, not usually, but Spiderman's kind of one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Me too, actually. They've made alot of movies about him but I always end up enjoying them."
"__MOVIES__ So you'll go see it, too?"
"__MOVIES__ I probably will, although it's going to be hard to top Wonder Woman's movie."
"__MOVIES__ I'll be the judge of that, when I go see it."
"__MOVIES__ You wanna go this weekend then? I don't mind seeing it again."
"__MOVIES__ Sure thing, you're on. See you there at eight."
