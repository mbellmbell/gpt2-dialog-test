"__DISNEY__ what do you think about Jungle Book?"
"__DISNEY__ It was such a brilliant movie, the visuals are insanely good"
"__DISNEY__ I can't agree more, the animals in the movie are lifelike, considering they're CG."
"__DISNEY__ yea, Disney might be the only company that can create visuals like that."
"__DISNEY__ yea, what's your most memorable moments from the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ It definitely gotta be the snake scene, where the snake try to hypnotize the kid"
"__DISNEY__ how about the huge ape scene, the kid climbed a very tall rock to get to talk to the huge ape."
"__DISNEY__ oh right, now that you mentioned, that was a great scene as well"
"__DISNEY__ I hope Disney make more excellent 3D iterations of their classic movies"
"__DISNEY__ yeah, even adult would be obsessed with those new dazzling visuals."
