"__BASKETBALL__ So you're a basketball fan, right?"

"__BASKETBALL__ What's your favorite team?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The NY Knicks."
"__BASKETBALL__ Have they been doing well lately?"
"__BASKETBALL__ ... No. Definitely no. They've been a trainwreck."
"__BASKETBALL__ That bad?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Unfortunately, yes."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why have they been doing so poorly?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Mainly really, really stupid trades."
"__BASKETBALL__ Ooh. That bad, huh."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yup. And wasting most of their money on a well-known player who's now past his prime."
"__BASKETBALL__ But isn't paying for well-known players pretty common?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Probably, but I think there are better team-building strategies."
"__BASKETBALL__ What would you recommend?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Building a team of good, young players."

"__BASKETBALL__ Anything else?"
"__BASKETBALL__ And when they become well-known players they hopefully feel some loyalty to the Knicks!"
