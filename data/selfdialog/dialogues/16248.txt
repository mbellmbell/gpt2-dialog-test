"__ROCK__ What rock band do you like a lot?"
"__ROCK__ I really like The Smashing Pumpkins."
"__ROCK__ Are they still around? I thought they stopped a long time ago."
"__ROCK__ No, they're still around but almost all of the original members are gone. It's just the singer, Billy Corgan who's left from the original lineup."
"__ROCK__ Well that doesn't really sound like they're still around if it's only one member."
"__ROCK__ Billy Corgan wrote almost all of their music and even mostly played all the instruments on their albums so in theory it should not sound any different with other members."
"__ROCK__ So so they sound the same as they did in the 90's?"
"__ROCK__ Weirdly, no, they don't sound like they did in the 90's. Their newer albums aren't all bad, Moment To An Elegy is a pretty good album, but it's still not as good as their older stuff."
"__ROCK__ Is there any chance of a reunion with all of the original members?"
"__ROCK__ I've read in the news that they have spoken to each other and are getting along these days so it's definitely a possibility. Actually James Iha played a few shows with Billy Corgan and The Smashing Pumpkins recently."
