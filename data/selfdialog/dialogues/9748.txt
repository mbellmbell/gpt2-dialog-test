"__COMEDY__ Do you know the movie Bad Grandpa?"
"__COMEDY__ Yep, I actually just watched it yesterday."
"__COMEDY__ Did you like it ?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, It was over the top hilarious just like the other movies with johnny noxville."
"__COMEDY__ I thought it was even better than the jackass movies."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, they didn't really have to use nudity and disgusting things to make it funny."
"__COMEDY__ Well, they did a little bit, but it was perfect."
"__COMEDY__ Haha, like the scene with the fish."
"__COMEDY__ Oh my god that scene was so funny I can't help but laugh every time I watch it."
"__COMEDY__ Same, I really enjoyed that part."
