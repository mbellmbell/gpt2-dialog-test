"__FASHION__ How would you describe your style?"
"__FASHION__ Umm, I don't think I fit into a category haha."
"__FASHION__ But if you had to chose one..."
"__FASHION__ Maybe I'm a hipster? I just wear what I like."
"__FASHION__ What kinda stuff do you like?"
"__FASHION__ It's gotta be unique and original. And better if it's vintage."
"__FASHION__ Where do you shop?"
"__FASHION__ Mostly just thrift stores. I like to find stuff there and make it my own."
"__FASHION__ What do you mean?"
"__FASHION__ I like to sew on things, add patches, cut pants into shorts... whatever strikes my fancy!"
"__FASHION__ Do you have a favorite piece of clothing?"
"__FASHION__ Probably some old cutoff bleached men's levis. I think they've been around since 1990!"
"__FASHION__ You'll have to show me the ropes of the thrift shop."
"__FASHION__ Totally. There's lots of great finds, no matter what your style."
"__FASHION__ As long as I can find something other than 20 year old shorts! haha"
"__FASHION__ Definitely. But I hope they have some more for me!"
"__FASHION__ What are you up to this weekend? My friend's and I are having a fashion swap!"
"__FASHION__ Cool! I do have a bunch of stuff I never wear."
"__FASHION__ There's gonna be a ton of people, and we all have different styles, so you'll be able to find whatever!"
"__FASHION__ Sweet! I'm in!"
