"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You sound like my mother... While I don't identify with it, I still respect it."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why would you? It does nothing but support violence, bad values, and we have no idea what they're saying!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't like country music either, but who am I to judge people that do. At the end of the day, lot of young people like the new rap, and there are even a few great artists that are inspirational."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They're all terrible. Name One that is inspirational."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Kendrick Lamar is."

"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Kendrick Lamar is 100% rap. It's not even hip-hop - it's pure rap."
