"__MOVIES__ Johnny Depp is such a good actor."
"__MOVIES__ He really is. Have you seen all his movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think all, but most, especially the more recent ones."
"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Benny and Joon?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, no. When was that from?"
"__MOVIES__ The 90s. Probably early 90s. I think it's my favorite Johnny Depp movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I've heard of the name but not much else."
"__MOVIES__ It also has Aidan Quinn, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Julianne Moore."
"__MOVIES__ Which one plays Joon? I'm guessing Johnny plays Benny?"
"__MOVIES__ Mary plays Joon and actually Benny is played by Aidan."
"__MOVIES__ So it's like a romance?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but probably not how you're thinking."
"__MOVIES__ What does that mean?"
"__MOVIES__ Benny and Joon are brother and sister, not a couple."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, I see. And Johnny and Julianne are the respective love interests?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, but it's complicated."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Joon is mentally ill and cared for by Benny and, uh, Johnny's character is given to Benny when he loses a card game."
"__MOVIES__ Wait, what?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha! Now that you're properly intrigued you need to watch the movie."
