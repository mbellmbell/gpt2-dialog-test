"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you excited about football season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, and it is quickly approaching!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It sure is; the NFL can not get here fast enough in my opinion!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Football fans can not stand to go a long time without watching the game we love!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of football, which position do you feel is the hardest to play?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you talking about in terms of physically or mentally?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You can use any criteria; just what position do you think is the toughest to perform at a high level at?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a really tough question!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I would say that quarterback is the toughest to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would you say that because of all the hits that they take?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really; I just feel that having to know so much verbiage would be really difficult."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That combined with having to process so much mentally would be challenging."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Would you agree with me then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Actually, I feel that playing cornerback would be the toughest position to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is interesting. Why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, with so many great, athletic receivers out there today; I just can not imagine keeping up with them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Especially having to cover certain guys one on one for the length of the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly! Can you imagine trying to cover Julio Jones all by yourself?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, often times those guys get help from their safeties with the big time receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is true, but there are normally several plays each game when they are all by themselves!"
