"__SUPERHERO__ The last Batman vs Superman movie was a turkey."
"__SUPERHERO__ Agreed.  Why was it so long?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm just kind of getting sick of these two and a half hour movies.  Could have cut a whole 30 to 45 minutes from the thing."
"__SUPERHERO__ Agreed.  I think Zach Snyder is a bit self-serving."
"__SUPERHERO__ What I don't get is why they cast Ben Affleck.  Totally the wrong choice."
"__SUPERHERO__ Guess he needed the paycheck."
"__SUPERHERO__ It should be interesting to see how this leads into Justice League."
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm a bit scared that they'll butcher that one as well."
"__SUPERHERO__ Either way, I'll pay my $10 and so will the rest of the world."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, me too.  Can't miss them either way!"
