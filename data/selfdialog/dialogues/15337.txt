"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just started watching the Harry Potter movies this weekend."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You just started watching them!? Why haven't you seen them before now?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I really like the books, but I was worried that the movies would ruin them for me."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, I understand. How far have you gotten?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I watched the first two last weekend."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And what do you think so far?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They're really similar to the books so far, I really like them. I think Daniel Radcliff is the perfect Harry."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The first three movies or so are really similar to the books, but they start to change things up a little in the fifth one and on."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, I'm looking forward to watching the rest."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Let me know what you think!"
