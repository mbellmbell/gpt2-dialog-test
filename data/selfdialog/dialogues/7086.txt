"__ICEHOCKEY__ Season's over."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yep, the Wild tried this year, but the blues goaltending is hot at the right time."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ When do the blues play again?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I don't know. Sometime later this week"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ DO you think they will make the finals"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No. To be honest, their offense just isn't good enough. They need to rely on defense."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Given their goalie's performance in this series, no kidding."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Tarasenko could give most teams a run for their money, but that's about it."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ And do think we lost to a team that's just bigger than us and clogs lanes."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea, the Wild didn't learn fast enough, did they?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Do you think we keep big name talen like Suter and Parise around?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea, I think we are just a couple tools short of a cup."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I hope they want to stay."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea, Suter is young and could be lured away."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am worried that losing Suter or Praise will take our punch away"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Totally agree, but it's a business"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Well, to next year's Wild."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ let's do well in the nhl draft"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Or spend a bunch of money and tradw"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ that too"
