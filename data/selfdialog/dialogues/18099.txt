"__MOVIES__ Have you ever seen MirrorMask?"
"__MOVIES__ I've never even heard of it."
"__MOVIES__ You gotta check it out sometime."
"__MOVIES__ What is it about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's almost sort of like a dark, surreal Alice in Wonderland, but it's also its own film."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds crazy."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I mean, Neil Gaiman did write it."
"__MOVIES__ No kidding? I didn't know he also did movies."
"__MOVIES__ He does sometimes. He also co-wrote the 2007 Beowulf film."
"__MOVIES__ The man is so talented."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but anyway, MirrorMask was also done by the The Jim Henson Company."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, are there a lot of puppets in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Actually, no, it uses a lot more computer generated effects instead."
"__MOVIES__ That's disappointing."
"__MOVIES__ You should give it a view anyway. It's sort of like Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds interesting. Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ A bunch of people you probably wouldn't know. Oh, but Stephen Fry does voice work for the film."
"__MOVIES__ When did it come out?"
"__MOVIES__ It came out in 2005, and was made on a small budget, but looks amazing despite that. It did get a super small theatrical release though."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, I guess I'll see if I can't find a copy at some point."
