"__HORROR__ What was your favorite era of horror films?"
"__HORROR__ Wow that's tough, The 80's probably with the 70's and 50's close behind."
"__HORROR__ The 80's had so many gems."
"__HORROR__ It absolutely did, Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday The 13th, even some of the early Halloween sequels."
"__HORROR__ Yeah and Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger, that alone wins it for me."
"__HORROR__ They are the not so holy Trinity of horror characters in my mind."
"__HORROR__ Would have to agree there my friend, even though some sequels we're pretty maligned."
"__HORROR__ Make as many films as all three of those characters have and there's bound to be a few stinkers"
"__HORROR__ Oddly enough even the less harealded films were still enjoyable."
"__HORROR__ Yeah can't go wrong with classic horror movies."
