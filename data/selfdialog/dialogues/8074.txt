"__POP__ Have you heard of Carley Rae Jepsen?"
"__POP__ Yeah, she sang Call Me Maybe, I remember that song."
"__POP__ What do you think of it?"
"__POP__ It's pretty corny. Some people say it's catchy but I don't see it."
"__POP__ Well, she has done other stuff, it couldn't hurt to check her other stuff out."
"__POP__ I'll give her other stuff a listen one of these days."
"__POP__ I don't recommend It Takes Two. The original was a great rap song, but this version isn't very good."
"__POP__ Remakes don't tend to be as good as the originals, though."
"__POP__ There have been some, though, that were pretty good."
"__POP__ I remember Tainted Love being one of the exceptions."
