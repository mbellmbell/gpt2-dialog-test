"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who's going to the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Patriots for sure, nobody can stop them in the AFC.  Maybe the Cowbows in NFC?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys?  Seriously?  Come on, Seahawks in the NFC!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah right.  Their defense is getting old, and Russell Wilson is one sack away from their offense being a bust."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No way.  Yes, the defense is getting older, but come on, they're still one of the top defenses."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, but I still think it's the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dak Prescott over Russell Wilson? You must be kidding."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, Dak Prescott is the man!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Russell Wilson, any day.  Dude might be shorter, but he has more heart and can do crazy things with the football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Now if only he could play defense too..."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Stop with the defense thing!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But it's true, they are getting old."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Richard Sherman is still a shutdown corner."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But wasn't he almost traded?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But he wasn't, he's still there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True.  But I bet he doesn't play as well this year, knowing he's probably done with the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And don't forget the rest of the Legion of Boom...Kam Chancellor, Earl Thomas?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Aren't they both brittle with injuries?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whatever dude, we'll see who's laughing at the end of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, we will."
