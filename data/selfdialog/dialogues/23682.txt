"__DISNEY__ I saw a top ten lisit of the 10 saddest Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ Wait, let me guess... the saddest one would be... Bambi."
"__DISNEY__ I thought so too !!! But no, Bambi was number four on the list."
"__DISNEY__ What was the saddest one?"
"__DISNEY__ A movie called UP. Lion King was second, and The Fox and The Hound was third."
"__DISNEY__ Lion King was pretty sad when Simba was snuggled up next to his dead dad."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I guess it's the child losing a parent that really tugs on the heartstrings. Dumbo was number 7 because of his mother rocking him through the cage with her trunk."
"__DISNEY__ Aw, that was really sad. There's something about cartoon characters with tears that makes me have tears too."
"__DISNEY__ There was one I had forgotten about though that was number 5, and when I saw it thought that should have been up there in the top 3- Old Yeller."
"__DISNEY__ Oh my gosh, that was really heartbreaking. I don't think anybody has ever watched Old Yeller and not shed a few tears."
