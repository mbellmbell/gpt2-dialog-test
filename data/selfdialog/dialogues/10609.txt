"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you think that Grime will ever be a big subgenre in America?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I'm not too sure. Drake did it justice in exposing it on More Life, but I don't think it resonated with fans."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I agree. I'm not sure if Americans have that acquired yearning for rap with deep British accents."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not just that, but it's a grittier type of music too."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Definitely. Regardless, rappers like Stormzy and Skepta are killing it with their delivery and flows."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I can definitely agree, Konichiwa was so underrated."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ All of the guys on Boy Better Know have very diverse yet hard bars."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly, and their sounds are all so different and fresh."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Sometimes I wish American rappers would step out of the box like British Grime artists do."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yep, but for now, we have to deal with the copy cat flows."
