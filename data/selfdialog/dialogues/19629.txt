"__MOVIES__ Did you see Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I've been meaning to though! How did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was okay. If I'm being honest, the plot was a little predictable, so I wasn't as impressed as I might have been."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I'm not super into superhero movies either. I'll probably watch it when it comes to Netflix."
"__MOVIES__ Good idea. I recently saw Get Out as well, which I loved."
"__MOVIES__ Me too! I really hope it wins some awards."
"__MOVIES__ Same, it was honestly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."
"__MOVIES__ Allison Williams played her character so perfectly. It was scary."
"__MOVIES__ I know! I've watched some of the interviews she given for the movie, and she talk about how unnerving it was to play that character."
"__MOVIES__ I can imagine. I wonder who else they considered for that role."
"__MOVIES__ You should listen to some of the Jordan Peele interviews too. His take on the movie is really interesting."
"__MOVIES__ I will check those interviews out. What other movies have you seen recently?"
"__MOVIES__ My friend dragged me to Beauty and the Beast a month or so ago."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, what did you think of it? I saw it right after it came out."
"__MOVIES__ It is was pretty good. I've actually never seen the cartoon version, and didn't actually know how it ended!"
"__MOVIES__ That is amazing; it is a pretty predicable plot as well though."
"__MOVIES__ True. The set was really beautiful though; I enjoyed it."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. I love Emma Watson."
"__MOVIES__ She is the best. I almost felt like she was too good for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I've heard other people say that too. I thought she did a good job though."
