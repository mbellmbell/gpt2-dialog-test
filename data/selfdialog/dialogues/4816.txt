"__MUSIC__ Do you like Diana Ross?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I do. I have a lot of her music in my music library on my phone."
"__MUSIC__ She will be performing at The Mann Music Center in Philadelphia later this summer."
"__MUSIC__ I think I might want to get some tickets to go see her. I have never seen her live in concert before."
"__MUSIC__ Has she released any music lately?"
"__MUSIC__ I doubt it. I stlll play songs from her Diana album from the early eighties."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that the album with I'm Coming Out on it?"
"__MUSIC__ I think it is. I like Sweet Hangover."
"__MUSIC__ That's the one where she goes, '...if there's a cure for this, I don't want it, don't want it'."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's it. I also like Friend to Friend."
"__MUSIC__ Man, Friend to Friend is a sleeper. I played that for my girl one time."
"__MUSIC__ Did she like it?"
"__MUSIC__ She didn't know who it was. I told her it was Diana Ross."
"__MUSIC__ What she say?"
"__MUSIC__ The same Diana Ross from Motown and the Supremes? I told her, yep, sure enough."
"__MUSIC__ I like her better after she went solo though."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. The Supremes and that Motown sound were just a little bit before my time."
"__MUSIC__ Mine too. But it was all still good music though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Barry Gordy had a music machine back then."
"__MUSIC__ Back then? Still does. I'm sure that music catalog is worth millions if not billions."
