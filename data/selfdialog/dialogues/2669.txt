"__MUSIC__ Hey, do you like punk music?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah I do!  Do you have any favorite bands?"
"__MUSIC__ Yep, I have SO MANY that I absolutely love.  The ones I think are the best are The Dead Kennedys, FEAR, D. I., The Germs, & The Sex Pistols."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow, you definitely have to include the Pistols in any collection!"
"__MUSIC__ No joke!  They are the 'grandfathers' of the genera!"
"__MUSIC__ I have to say that The Dead Kennedys are my favorite out of all of the ones you listed though."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you like them above all of the others?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, because of the political stance that the band took.  They always had the best lyrics to go with the climate."
"__MUSIC__ What do you think they'd say about the current state of affairs??"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I'm pretty sure that Biafra would totally slam everyone!"
"__MUSIC__ Were you ever able to see them in concert?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not the whole band.  I was just able to see Jello Biafra doing spoken word."
"__MUSIC__ Which other punk bands do you listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like FEAR too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, have you ever seen them live?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I sure did!  Had to drive all the way out to Chicago to see them."
"__MUSIC__ Well, how was the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ It was great!  The venue was small enough that you really got to hear the music & actually SEE the band playing!"
"__MUSIC__ I wish that there were bands now that had the same sound as the 70's & 80's punk bands."
"__MUSIC__ Me too, but there could always be some miracle band in the future that would bring that sound back!"
