"__DISNEY__ Have you ever watched The Little Mermaid?"
"__DISNEY__ No. I told you I haven't seen many Disney movies."
"__DISNEY__ You're so uncivilised!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, my mom didn't let me watch a lot of Disney movies growing up."
"__DISNEY__ How come?"
"__DISNEY__ She was against the magic in them she said."
"__DISNEY__ Aw, that's too bad. I think there are plenty of Disney movies that don't have magic in them though."
"__DISNEY__ Like which ones?"
"__DISNEY__ A lot of the older ones I think. There were some ones about famour historical figures, and wasn't there one about some animals trying to find their way home?"
"__DISNEY__ That sounds familiar!"
