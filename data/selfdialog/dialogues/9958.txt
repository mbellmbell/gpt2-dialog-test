"__COMEDY__ I figured for our Saturday movie marathon we'd watch some Mel Brooks comedys."
"__COMEDY__ Awesome, I assume Spaceballs is one of them"
"__COMEDY__ Of course, spaceballs the lunch box, space balls the flame thrower."
"__COMEDY__ One of the best lines of the movie.  I heard they are in talks for an actual spaceballs 2."
"__COMEDY__ No way.  Rick Moranis is actually coming out of retirement for it."
"__COMEDY__ So I hear.  Can't have Spaceballs with out him as Lord Helmet."
"__COMEDY__ No you can't.  I also picked Young Frankenstien"
"__COMEDY__ Another of my favorites.  Gene Wilder is the best."
"__COMEDY__ I know, so sad he passed away."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, but the best way to honor him is to keep watching his movies."
