"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, I am so excited about the upcoming season for the Chiefs. How about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, they did great last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, I would love to see them in the playoffs again this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, but they never seem to win playoff games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but Andy Reid has been great for the team and I think they are headed in the right direction."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, I am just concerned about some of the players we lost in the off season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is concerning, but I am thinking that they will get some great players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so I would love to see them with a winning record and with a trip to the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we should try to go to some games this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely, I hope they are playing the Detroit Lions this year I would love to see that game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, last time they played it was in London."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know I was bummed I couldn't go."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think they play them this year, because they are different divisions it only happens every 3-4 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is a bummer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait to go see them play anytime!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love Arrowhead Stadium, it is the loudest in the NFL and it is an amazing experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I love it too, it gets my blood pumping just walking in there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we should wait and go in November or December, it will give them time to find their groove."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, let's do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe they will play on Thanksgiving, that would be a fun game."
