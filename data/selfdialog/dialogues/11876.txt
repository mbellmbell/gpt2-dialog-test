"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey there, I'm pretty excited for the football season to start, are you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely!  I'm getting ready to start draft for my fantasy football league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh really?  You have a football league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely!  You want to join?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most definitely, last year in my other league I very mistakenly put my faith in some of the bears players like alshon jeffrey, I'd love a chance at redemption"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, the bears have been absolutely terrible as of late."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I'm hoping with the dump of Jay Cutler that the bears can actually improve.  Who knows, maybe they'll have a shot of making a comeback like the Cubs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, I think it's going to take a while for the bears to rebuild their dynasty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know who I miss?  Urlacher, that guy was the heart and soul of that team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the defense and the o-line has been horrible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's not small wonder Cutler was perpetually sacked, man couldn't get rid of the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who are going to be your top picks this year for the draft?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh definitely members of the patriots if I can, like brady, gronkowski, edelman."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the patriots are killing it...but do you think that the broncos can come back without manning behind the helm?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have a lot of talent in their wide receivers...but you have to have a high quality QB at the helm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And decent running backs, last year I had todd gurley as one of my first picks, dude hardly got me ANYTHING!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Matt Ryan could be strong at the helm for the falcons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It depends on if he can continue his hot streak of if he slowly peters out like Manning did."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah...I'm still bitter about his abysmal performance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well here's to kicking off 'any given Sunday'!"
