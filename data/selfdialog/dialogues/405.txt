"__MUSIC__ Do you like any of today's music artists?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. I do like Drake and Kendrick Lamar though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah they are pretty creative with it. What's your favorite Drake song?"
"__MUSIC__ That would definitely have to be Hotline Bling. It's super catchy."
"__MUSIC__ That's my favorite of his too. I loved Erykah Badu's version of it."
"__MUSIC__ Erykah redid Hotline Bling? Is it a totally different sound."
"__MUSIC__ No she left the first part of the music the same, changed the lyrics a little, but the last part is all Erykah."
"__MUSIC__ I loved her first album, Baduizm"
"__MUSIC__ That's what the last part of her Hotline Bling sounds like."
"__MUSIC__ That's great, I have to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like any other Erykah Badu songs?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course I do. Next Lifetime is one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ Tyrone is a great one, and also Back in the Day."
"__MUSIC__ Love of My Life was a nice little homage to hip hop."
"__MUSIC__ It really was. I wish her and Andre 3000 had stayed together."
"__MUSIC__ Me too I thought they were the perfect couple."
"__MUSIC__ That song Miss Jackson that Outkast did, I think that was about her and her mom."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's the common concensus. She was the only one he had kids with at the time."
"__MUSIC__ Wow that's crazy. So do you like a lot of Outkast's music."
"__MUSIC__ Yes their ATLiens is the best out of all of them if you ask me."
