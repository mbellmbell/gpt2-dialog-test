"__MUSIC__ Do you know what band I've been listening to a lot lately?q"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, who?"
"__MUSIC__ The Grateful Dead!"
"__MUSIC__ Are you serious?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I never really got into them before."
"__MUSIC__ So does this mean you're a huge hippie now?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that's the thing. That's all I could associate them with."
"__MUSIC__ Like, patchouli and good vibes man."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. But I tried to ignore my associations with all that hippie culture, and their music is actually great!"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I mean I guess I never really gave them a chance either. I thought it would be super cheesy."
"__MUSIC__ That's exactly what I thought."
"__MUSIC__ So was their a specific song that changed your mind?"
"__MUSIC__ Wharf Rat. It's amazing."
"__MUSIC__ What album is that from?"
"__MUSIC__ It's from their eponymous 'Grateful Dead' record they released in 1971."
"__MUSIC__ That's easy enough to remember."
"__MUSIC__ Check it out. It's legitimately a classic."
"__MUSIC__ I'll do that. I guess they couldn't have had such a crazy following if they weren't at least... good."
"__MUSIC__ That one song especially.... it doesn't require any knowledge about them as a band, It's just a great intro to the Grateful Dead."
"__MUSIC__ Alright, I'll listen to it tonight."
