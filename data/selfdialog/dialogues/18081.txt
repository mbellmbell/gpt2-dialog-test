"__MOVIES__ I just recently watched Lucy with Scarlett Johannssen. Have you seen that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it's one of my favorite movies now. Brilliantly done."

"__MOVIES__ Well that's what they demonstrated in the movie but I do believe it would be true to some degree."
"__MOVIES__ She's such a great actress. I love her as Natasha Romanov or Black Widow."
"__MOVIES__ That's definitely where she's making her mark, in the Avengers Franchise."
"__MOVIES__ I love Marvel as a whole. Black Panther is coming out next year."
"__MOVIES__ I hope Storm will make an appearance, since that's his wife."
"__MOVIES__ I think I heard she was going to but I think the part will be played by someone other than Halle Berry."
"__MOVIES__ Right I think she'd be a little too old to be T'Challa's wife."
"__MOVIES__ She does look young though, I don't know. She could play it I think."
"__MOVIES__ She hasn't really been in anything noteworthy as of late."
"__MOVIES__ I loved her in Monster's Ball. She won the oscar for that one."
"__MOVIES__ Right she was the first African American woman to win for best actress."

"__MOVIES__ With Eddie Murphy and Tommy Davidson? Of course, I saw it again not too long ago."
"__MOVIES__ That was a hilarious movie. She's come a long way since then."
"__MOVIES__ I love going back to look at 90s films every now and then just to relive my teenage years."
