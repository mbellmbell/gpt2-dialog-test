"__MOVIES__ Dredd from 2012 is the best comic book movie."
"__MOVIES__ Really? I thought you hated comic book movies."
"__MOVIES__ I'm tired of them, yes."
"__MOVIES__ We all are. Reboots too."
"__MOVIES__ This one was actually a decent movie and true to the source material."
"__MOVIES__ It has to be better than the Stallone version from the nineties."
"__MOVIES__ Yes. They sort of do a Die Hard thing, all in one building."
"__MOVIES__ But with Judge Dredd?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ That's cool. It has the Star Trek guy right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he wears a mask."
"__MOVIES__ Good."
"__MOVIES__ It also has Judge Anderson and a bunch of refs. The Villian is good too."
"__MOVIES__ That's the best part of Judge Dredd."
"__MOVIES__ It didn't make any money, though."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't that how it always is?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, a movie has to sell a million tickets in China or it's not worth having made it."
"__MOVIES__ Like Warcraft."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. Total garbage."
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunate."
