"__MOVIES__ That movie is really cool."
"__MOVIES__ I like the cgi in it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you know that James Cameron wanted to make Avatar in 1999?"
"__MOVIES__ No, why didn't he?"
"__MOVIES__ It would of had to have a budget of $400 million dollars."
"__MOVIES__ Dang that is expensive."
"__MOVIES__ James Cameron also didn't think the cgi then was ready for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What made him change his mind?"
"__MOVIES__ James Cameron saw Gollum in Lord of the Rings and knew cgi could do Avatar now."
