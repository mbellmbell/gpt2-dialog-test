"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Tyrese has to be my favorite character in the Fast and Furious series. He's just so funny."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Roman Pearce! He's got the best one liners. He's pretty much the comic relief of the series now."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I love how he makes light of the situations they get in and he's always the one who has to struggle through."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The last one, Fate of the Furious, he was hilarious in that."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I loved when he took the Lamborghini out to the ice and everyone looked at him like he was crazy for taking that type of car out to that environment."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ That scene was wild. I loved the craziness that was the submarine they were trying to out run."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I've never seen a car chase involving a submarine before. A first for everything!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I mean it was great because it was a submarine, but that submarine was also launching torpedoes at the cars!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm trying to think of another scene in the series or any other movies that had something that outrageous."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm drawing a blank, but Fate of the Furious had a lot of over the top moments!"
