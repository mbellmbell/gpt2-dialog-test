"__MUSIC__ I hear you really like Bruce Springsteen."
"__MUSIC__ You heard right."
"__MUSIC__ So, if I asked you any song, could you tell me what album it is on?"
"__MUSIC__ I could tell you most of them, but probably not all."
"__MUSIC__ Well let's give it a shot. How about Badlands?"
"__MUSIC__ Well that's an easy one! It's my favorite song and my favorite album. Darkness on the Edge of Town."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, how about Blinded by the Light?"
"__MUSIC__ First album - Greetings from Asbury Park."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't even realize he sang that song until recently."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It didn't really become a big hit until Manfred Mann's Earth Band sang it."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't he have another song like that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, the two he wrote for others that went big were Fire and Because the Night."
"__MUSIC__ Because the Night was Pat Benetar right?"
"__MUSIC__ You know, I always thought so, but it was actually Patti Smith and then 10,000 Maniacs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I forgot about them. Didn't they have a female lead?"
"__MUSIC__ Natalie Merchant I believe."
"__MUSIC__ Did she ever do anything solo?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yes, for many years. But I couldn't tell you one of her songs."
"__MUSIC__ I'm sure she has some that we'd know if we heard it."
"__MUSIC__ Right. We just don't realize it is her."
