"__MOVIES__ What movies are currently playing at the theater?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not sure. The only one I know of is Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I want to see that! It has Emma Watson in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes it does. From the pictures she looks like a great fit."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Do you know what else is out?"
"__MOVIES__ No. But I did watch a movie on Netflix last week."
"__MOVIES__ I do that a lot. What movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Bridget Jones' Baby. Have you seen it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes I did. It was absolutely hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ I will definitely watch it again. Did you see the part where the mom held the facetime to her ear?"
"__MOVIES__ That was my favorite part of the whole movie. My mom is just like that and terrible with technology."
"__MOVIES__ Do you know the names of the two male actors who she thinks may be the dad?"
"__MOVIES__ I have no idea, but I have seen the British guy in other movies."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. Do you remember the ending?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she lives happily ever after."
"__MOVIES__ Typical."
"__MOVIES__ I know right? What is your favorite movie of all time?"
"__MOVIES__ Probably Juno. It is such a risky movie on teen pregnancy."
"__MOVIES__ I liked that movie, but I wouldn't call it my favorite. My favorite is Stranger Than Fiction."
"__MOVIES__ I watched that but hated it. What a quirky movie."
