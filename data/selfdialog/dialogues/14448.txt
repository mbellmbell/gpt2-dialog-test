"__HORROR__ Have you seen the preview for the new It."
"__HORROR__ I have. Uber creepy."
"__HORROR__ I think they top ol Tim Curry."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, but the first one wasn't all that scary."
"__HORROR__ True. I actually watched that on Holloween in a cemetary!"
"__HORROR__ How'd you pull that off?"
"__HORROR__ My cousin was renting a place that happened to be smack dab in a cemetary."
"__HORROR__ Crazy! Did you get scared?"
"__HORROR__ No. That's my point. The new one looks way freakier."
"__HORROR__ I'll have to agree with you there."
