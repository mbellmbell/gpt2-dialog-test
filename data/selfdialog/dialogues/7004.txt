"__ICEHOCKEY__ My son is an ice hockey player. What sports do your children play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ My children do not play sports but are interested in ice  hockey, how do they get started?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Our town has an ice hockey team at the local ice rink. Our son started playing in second grade."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He must have known how to skate before he started playing ice hockey."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Nope, he suited up in all of his gear including padded pants, knee pads, a helmet and skates and was off on the ice."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How long before he was playing ice hockey games?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He started playing competitive ice hockey in the third grade."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Wow that is impressive."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He learned to skate and control the puck very quickly. The challenge was doing both at the same time without falling down."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are there ice hockey camps?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, lots of camps are available in the area that work on both skating skills and puck skills during the summer."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ How much of an investment is it for children to play hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ In our town about $2000 a year with all of the gear. Of course with a growing boy you need new skates every year. We also travel a lot so there are extra costs."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ This is a bit expensive are there other options?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Actually, $2000 is very reasonable. If you travel down the hill you will be paying about $5000 a year if not more and it is very competitive."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Are their options for non-competitive play?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Absolutely, there are house teams that you can join that do not travel."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Can you buy used equipment or borrow equipment?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes, we started with borrowed equipment to make sure our son was really willing to commit to playing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I will have to look into this ice hockey opportunity."
