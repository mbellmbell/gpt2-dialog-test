"__DISNEY__ I miss watching Lilo and Stitch, we should see it again some time."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I loved the music in it."
"__DISNEY__ My favorite song was the one in the beginning when Lilo so was swimming and giving Pudge the fish a sandwhich."
"__DISNEY__ I loved the amount of Elvis in there."
"__DISNEY__ Can we talk about Nani though? She's such a lovely character."
"__DISNEY__ I know right? She looks like an actual human being compared to the rest of Disney's animated women."
"__DISNEY__ Not to mention that it's emphasized that her and Lilo's relationship isn't perfect."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I can't imagine having to raise my own sibling at that age for either of them."
"__DISNEY__ I can't imagine having to live with Stitch, Pleakly, and Jumba."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, that's true."
