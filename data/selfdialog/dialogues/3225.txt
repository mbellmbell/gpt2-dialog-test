"__MUSIC__ Hi! What are you doing today?"
"__MUSIC__ Today I plan to make a new playlist of my favorite songs."
"__MUSIC__ What type of music do you like to listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ I like all types of music, but this will be a rock playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Rock music.  I really enjoy rock music too!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, rock isn't my favorite type of music, but I do like to listen to it when I work out."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I bet that it gives you a lot of energy to work out to rock music."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, that's the plan.  I listen to rock music to keep me moving."
"__MUSIC__ That is a great idea!"
"__MUSIC__ I've always used rock music when I work out.  Right now I'm a little tired of my current playlist."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  You need to add some Queen to your playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Which song?"
"__MUSIC__ How about We are the Champions.  It is a must have at any athletic event."
"__MUSIC__ I guess you are right."
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget We Will Rock you too! I think those two songs are usually played together."
"__MUSIC__ I think you are right.  I'll add them to my playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, you've inspired me to make my own work out playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Good.  Maybe we could work on a list together and then I could share it with you."
"__MUSIC__ I like that idea.  I have a few more suggestions."
"__MUSIC__ Super!  Let's get started."
