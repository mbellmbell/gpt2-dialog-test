"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the Lion King?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes!  That is such an incredible movie."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  My daughter wants to watch it together."
"__MOVIES__ My daughter got really upset by it when the lion died.  It made her cry."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the only thing I was worried about.  It's still a great movie though."
"__MOVIES__ I would maybe just talk to her about it beforehand so she's prepared."
"__MOVIES__ That's what I was planning to do."
"__MOVIES__ There's actually a sequel to it, did you know that?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I had no idea.  What's it called?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember, but my kids have it.  I haven't seen it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh crazy.  I guess it wasn't as popular as the original."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah I'm not sure it even came out in theatres."
"__MOVIES__ Well, if it's anything like the first one it'd be a great movie."
"__MOVIES__ The supporting characters are hilarious in the Lion King."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I know.  It's got a great moral too."
"__MOVIES__ It came out a long time ago, didn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was sometime in the nineties, yes."
"__MOVIES__ I think the older Disney movies were better than a lot of the new stuff."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they were definitely different."
"__MOVIES__ It seems like the digital animation really changed everything."
