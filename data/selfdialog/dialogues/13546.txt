"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ what do you think of players entering the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ what do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ like, do you think they are as good as the people already drafted?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ probably not, to be honest, but that's not really their fault."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, people who are drafted are relatively young, aren't they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, i think a lot are between 18 and 25."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ some are even drafted out of high school."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, but not a lot, only the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yep, why do you think they draft so young?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ probably to keep people around the longest."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, and the fact that younger people are more agile and quick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ not all the time, though, some older players are still better than the young ones."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ like who?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ you know, the legends - brady, farve, etc."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ i feel like some people in the NFL have a natural knack at it, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ that's because they do, everyone has a natural talent somewhere."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ and for some it's football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ yeah, except they still have to retire eventually."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well i'm interested to see who gets drafted next."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ me too."
