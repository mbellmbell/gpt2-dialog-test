"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay, so I don't really understand this football stuff at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What don't you understand?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, I want to be able to enjoy NFL games when we watch them. But I don't get the basic rules."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like, about what down it is?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. What's a down?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh wow. Okay. Back to basics then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A down is like a play. If you play four times without getting 10 yards forward, the other team gets the ball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Okay. That makes sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And it resets if you move forward 10 or more yards."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can understand that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything else?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You score the most points."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How do you score points?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you either get a touchdown, or through a kick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is worth more?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A touchdown."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess I've got a lot to figure out."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I bet the NFL sells a rulebook!"
