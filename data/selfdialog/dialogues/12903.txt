"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ok, what do you think is the best NFL city?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's Chicago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why Chicago?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have great fans and love the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So do the Cowboys fans."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Here, how about Buffalo."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That town isn't a good NFL city."
