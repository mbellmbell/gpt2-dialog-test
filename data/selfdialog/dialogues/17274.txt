"__MOVIES__ Hey, what're you up to today?"
"__MOVIES__ It's raining and cold. Probably just going to lay around and Netflix it today. Any recommendations?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, let me think about it. Any genres you like?"
"__MOVIES__ Horror, suspense, comedy. I'm up for anything."
"__MOVIES__ I saw a good one last weekend I'd definitely recommend."
"__MOVIES__ What was it called? I'm up for something new."
"__MOVIES__ It was a zombie movie, but an interesting one. All in Korean with subtitles."
"__MOVIES__ Sweet, I love zombie movies. Not so sure about the subtitles though. I'm not a huge fan of reading while watching."
"__MOVIES__ It was called Train to Busan directed by Yeon Sang-ho. Trust me, it's worth it."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah?"
"__MOVIES__ Totally, you almost done even realize that there are subtitles because there's so much action."
"__MOVIES__ Does it all take place on a train? The whole thing?"
"__MOVIES__ Most of it, but not the whole thing, no. It's set throughout Korea too."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds like an interesting concept."
"__MOVIES__ You should watch it!"
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to give it a try."
"__MOVIES__ Definitely ranks up there with one of my favorite zombie/apocalyptic movies."
"__MOVIES__ Awesome, thank you for the recommendation. I'll check it out."
"__MOVIES__ No problem, let me know what you think of it."
"__MOVIES__ I will! Off to Netflix land I go, haha."
