"__STAR_WARS__ In all the Star Wars movies, who is your favorite character?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would probably have to say either Han Solo or Obi Wan Kenobi."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, Han Solo is one of my favorites too."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's such a good character and Harrison Ford plays him so well, especially in the first trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, he's good at playing kind of like the rascally, space pirate type of character."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, him and Chewbacca are such an unlikely pair, but someone how it works so well."
"__STAR_WARS__ He definitely brought a lot of comic relief to the movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea and his own individual storyline was really interesting too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yea, I heard they're making a separate movie that is just all about Han Solo."
"__STAR_WARS__ Really?! That would be awesome!"
