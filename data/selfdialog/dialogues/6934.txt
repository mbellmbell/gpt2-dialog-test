"__STAR_WARS__ Did you know they are doing a Han Solo movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I was unaware of that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah its supposedly just going to be focused on just him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think this ruins Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because the plot needs to be linear."
"__STAR_WARS__ So you dont like spin off types of movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No I think it gets hard for a fan to keep up."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well its not like a show where you need to keep up with the way the plot moves."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah I mean I know you have time but I think its all a bit wrangling."
