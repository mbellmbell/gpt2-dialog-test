"__MOVIES__ Did you like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard more?"
"__MOVIES__ Die Hard, hands down."
"__MOVIES__ Now that they've done the recent sequels, I'm not sure if I agree with you."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, fair. Die Hard only up to With A Vengeance."
"__MOVIES__ Is that the one with Samuel L. Jackson?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep. It was my favorite one of them, too."
"__MOVIES__ Really! I never got around to seeing it."
"__MOVIES__ Dude, you have to check it out."
"__MOVIES__ Is it just because Samuel L. Jackson's awesome?"
"__MOVIES__ No... I mean yeah, but mainly it's just fun watching the two of them act off each other."
"__MOVIES__ Bruce Willis and Sam L. Jackson had a good dynamic?"
"__MOVIES__ A really awesome dynamic. So much great humor. Also, the bad guy is awesome."
"__MOVIES__ That's good. I didn't think the Russian bad guys in the second one were very good."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was a little hackneyed. This one is much more like the first."
"__MOVIES__ Oh with Hans Gruber?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I won't give anything more away, though."
"__MOVIES__ That's cryptic, haha. Okay, though."
"__MOVIES__ And also the action pacing of it is fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, okay, I get it. I'll pick it up soon."
"__MOVIES__ You should call me when you do. I'll totally watch it with you now that I'm thinking about it so much, haha."
