"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What did you think of the 3rd Fast & Furious movie?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I had mixed feelings about that one, I mean none of the original characters and some random guy as lead."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah I get what you mean, but it was still pretty cool."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah especially when Han was showing off why he drifts and the girl passes him her phone number."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I was thinking the same thing. What did you think about Twink's ride."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ The green Hulk mobile?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yeah, I though it was pretty sweet."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ You also think tires are free don't you?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well obviously someone liked it or it wouldn't be in the movie."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Obviously they only liked it enough to have it in like 2 scenes for comic relief."
