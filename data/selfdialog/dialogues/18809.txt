"__MOVIES__ Have you seen Alien: Covenant yet?"
"__MOVIES__ No, not yet--don't spoil it for me!"
"__MOVIES__ I'm not going too, I can't, I haven't seen it either."
"__MOVIES__ Good, I'm really looking forward to it."
"__MOVIES__ Me too; I really liked Prometheus."
"__MOVIES__ I did too, even though some of the critics were hard."
"__MOVIES__ The critics are beating up on this one a little, too. They say it is real slow."
"__MOVIES__ I don't mind, as long as they show what happens with the engineers and the woman from the first one."
"__MOVIES__ I think the android David kills all the engineers, or something."
"__MOVIES__ Don't spoil it!"
"__MOVIES__ Don't worry, I'm not sure it's right. Besides, it was all over the internet before the movie came out so it's probably wrong."
"__MOVIES__ Good, I don't want it spoiled."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder if they will show how the Xenomorphs are created?"
"__MOVIES__ That wasn't really clear in Prometheus."
"__MOVIES__ No, it wasn't."
"__MOVIES__ Prometheus raised more questions than it answered."
"__MOVIES__ I agree! I hope to see it soon."
"__MOVIES__ We should see it together! What are doing Friday."
"__MOVIES__ I'm free! Let's go."
"__MOVIES__ It's a date."
