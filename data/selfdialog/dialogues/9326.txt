"__BASEBALL__ My son has a ball game tonight."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, he's still playing?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, this is his fourth year."
"__BASEBALL__ What position is he playing this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ They tried letting him pitch at the beginning of the season, but that didn't work out."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, yeah?  Didn't go over well?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, he didn't do so bad, but there's another kid that does much better."
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, well where is he playing now?"
"__BASEBALL__ He's in the outfield."
"__BASEBALL__ Does he like playing there?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, he loves it, and he's actually a lot better in the outfield than he was pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ So it all worked out?"
"__BASEBALL__ Oh, yeah.  He'd rather catch flies than worry about throwing strikes anyhow."
"__BASEBALL__ How is he batting?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not bad at all.  He actually had a home run and a triple his last game."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, it sounds like you've got a star on your hands!"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, he's pretty talented to be honest."
"__BASEBALL__ It sounds like it!"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm just glad that he gets a chance to spend time doing something he loves."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, it's great when kids love sports."
