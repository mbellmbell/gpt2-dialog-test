"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I cannot wait for football season to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously? It's the middle of summer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but I think the Steelers are really going to do well this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope they do, but you still have a problem"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really have the Steelers number."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have everybody's number. Could you imagine the Steelers' Super Bowl trophy case if not for Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How many Conference championship games have they played?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Four, and that is the problem, they are in the same conference. So unless they can beat the Patriots they don't even get to go to the Super Bowl."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did they win any of the four?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No, the Patriots won them all and then went on to win the Super Bowl, I think, every time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Can anybody beat them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. Even though they lost, Atlanta showed that on any given Sunday, the Patriots can be beaten."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you sure about that?  I mean, the Patriots won the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but they needed a lot of luck."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't that what they have the most of? I mean, isn't it just luck that they win?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to think so, but I don't think that is really the case. There is another factor."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Tom Brady?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Tom Brady. I think he is going to play until he's fifty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be bad news for everyone else."
