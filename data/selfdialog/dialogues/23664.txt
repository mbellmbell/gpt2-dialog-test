"__DISNEY__ I think Kida may be my favorite disney princess..."
"__DISNEY__ Kida?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, from Atlantis."
"__DISNEY__ Oh! I almost forgot about that one."
"__DISNEY__ Seriously, I demand that you go see it again."
"__DISNEY__ Maybe tonight- no, definitely tonight."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, man because I think the animators used 2D and 3D to make it, just like Treasure Planet."
"__DISNEY__ Really, I love when they do that."
"__DISNEY__ It makes the movie even better when an animator spends so much time paying attention to detail."
"__DISNEY__ It does...it does."
