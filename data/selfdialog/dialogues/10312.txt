"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Have you heard Kendrick Lamar's new album??"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yes!! It is so good, probably my favorite rap album in several years."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I definitely agree with you, did you know he's touring as well?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I saw that he was coming here, but I bet tickets are crazy expensive."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It probably is, Kendrick Lamar is huge right now."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ You know who else I've been loving?? Childish Gambino"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right?! He is crazy talent. Definitely one of the best triple threats of 2017."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I would love to see him live, I bet that'd be an amazing concert."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I hear that he's going to stop making music after this album."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a huge bummer, I hope he changes his mind."
