"__FAST_FURIOUS__ A lot of people I know are big fans of the Fast & Furious series."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I am not one of those people."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Are you serious? I really thought that everyone liked those."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I'm dead serious. I can't stand those films."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Oh, come on! What's so bad about them?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They literally took street racing to global warfare. It's just plain dumb if you ask me."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ But it's super fun to watch."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Well, I've never found them fun. Just annoying."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ They at least have a stacked cast, though."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I can agree with that much, sure."
