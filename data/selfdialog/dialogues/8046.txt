"__POP__ Do you agree that  Michael Jackson was the king of pop?"
"__POP__ Yes 100% he was the king of pop."
"__POP__ So my question is who is the queen of pop then?"
"__POP__ Hard to say if there is one, he kind of created pop in a way. Not sure any females made the same impact on the music world."
"__POP__ No one can or will ever be as  great an influence on pop music. But who would you crown?"
"__POP__ Maybe Taylor Swift. She always is winning lots of awards."
"__POP__ But her start was in country. I don't think she should be queen of pop."
"__POP__ Well Michael started with his brothers in Motown and became King of pop."
"__POP__ That is a good point you make. Maybe she could deserve the title then... but I say lady gaga is a better choice."
"__POP__ I had not consider GAGA.She may be more of a pop princess."
