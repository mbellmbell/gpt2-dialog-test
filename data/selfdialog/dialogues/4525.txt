"__MUSIC__ I went to a Band of Horses conert the other night."
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of them.  What songs do they sing?"
"__MUSIC__ Their most popular ones are The Funeral and No One's Gonna Love You."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I've ever heard either of them.  What sort of music is it?"
"__MUSIC__ I would probably say it's alternative rock.  Very chill stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Are they a new band?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they've been around since about 2005.  They've got 5 albums so far."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check them out.  My favorite alternative rock band is The Smiths."
"__MUSIC__ You know Band of Horses is kind of like them.  My favorite song by The Smiths is There Is A Light That Never Goes Out."
"__MUSIC__ That is definitely their most popular.  I would say my favorite is How Soon is Now."
"__MUSIC__ It's very sad that they broke up in the 80s.  I feel like they could have gone on to make more music together."
"__MUSIC__ I heard they fought among themselves about royalties. Apparently Morrisey and Marr were taking most of the money and the other members weren't getting much."
"__MUSIC__ That's a shame when good music gets broken up over squabbles with money."
"__MUSIC__ I read an interview saying that Coldplay splits every song four ways so that they don't get into arguments about money."
"__MUSIC__ That seems smart but even the ones that Chris Martin writes himself?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I guess they're in it all together."
"__MUSIC__ Certainly works for them.  Coldplay has seven albums and I think they've been nominated for 62 awards."
"__MUSIC__ Wow, I knew they'd been around a while but I had no idea they had that much."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a huge fan of Coldplay though as far as alternative rock goes."
"__MUSIC__ I quite like them.  Yellow is definitely a good song."
