"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you follow American football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do. I love it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Have you ever been to a game before?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have only been to one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who was playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was the Colts versus the Texans in Indianapolis."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nice. Who ended up winning?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Texans won. The crowd was pretty upset."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm guessing you're a Colts fan, then?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I actually am not a fan of either teams. I got free tickets and I lived in Indiana at the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're not a fan of the team in your state?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I grew up closer to Chicago. I was raised a Bears fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nice. The bears have had a really rough time lately."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have. A lot of people blame Cutler."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. I don't think he can totally be blamed for it, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. Their offensive line does a very poor job of protecting him."

"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He also seems to be injured less."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does. Poor guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think it's time for them to make some major lineup changes."
