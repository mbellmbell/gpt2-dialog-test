"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any great movies this year?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, a few. My favorite so far has been Beauty and the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen that. I loved the animated version and was worried I would not love it as much."
"__MOVIES__ I loved the animation too, believe me you will not be disappointed."
"__MOVIES__ I am glad to hear that. I hate when they rain on your memories."
"__MOVIES__ The actors and effects are amazing. You will fall in love with the Beast."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I heard it was the actor from Downtown Abbey. I just couldn't see it."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you must, trust me, your heart will soar. If you loved the animation you will fall in love with this too."
"__MOVIES__ If you say so. Is the music all the same?"
"__MOVIES__ Pretty much, they did add a few new tunes. It is very well done."
"__MOVIES__ I will give it try. I have been looking forward to Tom Cruise in The Mummy."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that was not very good. I love Tom Cruise but will hold off for DVD on that one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I do not want to go and be disappointed. The trailer looked great."
"__MOVIES__ I agree, but so many people have said they didn't care for it. I don't want to spend the money on a ticket."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I would rather pay to see Wonder Woman twice."
"__MOVIES__ That's funny. I paid to see Beauty and the Beast three times."
"__MOVIES__ You did. I guess it is good."
"__MOVIES__ It is in my top ten of all time. Maybe even in the top five."
"__MOVIES__ Really, the animation was one of my top ten. I will go this week, I promise."
"__MOVIES__ Do you want company? I would definitely see it again."
