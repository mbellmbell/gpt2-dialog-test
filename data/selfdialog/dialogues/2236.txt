"__MUSIC__ Wow, I just saw a video by Felonious Lads."
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Felonious Lads.  They're a band with a fusion of rockabilly and pop rock."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds weird!"
"__MUSIC__ No, they're great!"
"__MUSIC__ Are you talking about the guy who sings with a snake around his neck?"
"__MUSIC__ No, that's SnakeJuice.  But they sound similar."
"__MUSIC__ I think Snake is more rock."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are."
"__MUSIC__ What does Felonious sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ Hmmmmm.  They remind me of pop rockers but dress like the 60s rockabilly guys."
"__MUSIC__ That sounds very cool."
"__MUSIC__ Actually, they're my favorite right now."
"__MUSIC__ Out of everybody?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, because they're so unique."
"__MUSIC__ I get that."
"__MUSIC__ Let me turn it up.  I'm listening to 'Break Out' now."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Did you like it?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, they are jamming!"
