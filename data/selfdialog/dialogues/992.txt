"__MUSIC__ What do you think the best type of music is?"
"__MUSIC__ When I think of the best kind of music I think of songs with no lyrics to them."
"__MUSIC__ You mean you like instrumentals?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love instrumentals."
"__MUSIC__ Would you always pick lyricless music over anything else?"
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't say all the time but I prefer my music to not have any lyrics in it."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I think instrumentals really bring out your emotions more than songs with lyrics?"
"__MUSIC__ I think songs with lyrics can do the same thing."
"__MUSIC__ Well they can but it's easier because you can say a bunch of things that would envoke an emotion."
"__MUSIC__ So why do you feel it;s better with instrumentals?"
"__MUSIC__ Well if a song can bring out an emotion in you without needing to say any words then you know the song is good."
"__MUSIC__ I never thought of it that way, that makes a lot of sense."
"__MUSIC__ Another reason I like them is because there are multiple benfits to listening to it."
"__MUSIC__ Benefits? Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ Well the main one for me is productivity. It helps me focus on work when I have something playing in the back ground."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting. I never knew that."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Another plus for me personally is it sets up my mood."
"__MUSIC__ Your mood?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, if I play something upbeat I am pretty chipper throughout the day."
