"__MUSIC__ Do you like indie music?"
"__MUSIC__ It depends on the band there is a lot of butt rock out there that claims to be indie rock."
"__MUSIC__ Surely it does depend on the quality of the artist but I like The Get Up Kids and People Under the Stairs."
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay those are some fun bands that have some good hits."
"__MUSIC__ I am also a huge fan of The Shins and Bright Eyes  but that is because I really grew up with those bands."
"__MUSIC__ What would you say is your favorite band of all times?"
"__MUSIC__ I think that is an impossible question and I really can't answer it because there is just so much good music. Do you have a favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I would say I have a favorite band and that would be Rise Against because they where a band I came up with."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know of Tom Waits?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, he is from Pomona California and was born in 1949. I would say he is the music for the author Jack Kerouac."
"__MUSIC__ Do you know of Rage Against the Machine?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I do and I find them to be an amazing band that just makes me feel so cool when I am listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ They are like the perfect band from Los Angeles, they also just have such a grunge like style."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah totally but also it's got that metal element that I so enjoy."
"__MUSIC__ Do you like death metal?"
"__MUSIC__ I like screamo but am more on the typical  metal side if there was a scale."
"__MUSIC__ One band that I kind of hate is Maroon 5, they are the worst and on occasion they show up in my music library and I find it so frustrating."
"__MUSIC__ Sure I hate them too but why don't you just delete them from your computer. Seems like a simple solution"
"__MUSIC__ All the music in my library is backed up so it becomes sort of impossible to delete music once in becomes a part of the library."
"__MUSIC__ Well that is a problem but there is never a problem with having too much music."
