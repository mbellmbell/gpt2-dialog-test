"__MUSIC__ I really love the Discover Weekly feature on Spotify."
"__MUSIC__ Oh? Why?"
"__MUSIC__ It does a pretty incredible job of picking out songs I wouldn't have found otherwise but which really suit my taste."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool. What is it exactly?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a playlist that updates every week with songs they think you'll like."
"__MUSIC__ Is it all new music?"
"__MUSIC__ It is mostly new, though it has some older things that you've never listened to before in it as well."
"__MUSIC__ Cool, I'll have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ You should. I've never had a bad song in mine, and there is usually at least 1 per week that winds up being a favorite."
"__MUSIC__ What is in yours this week?"
"__MUSIC__ It has Sander Kleinenberg, ZHU, Stanton Warriors, Pablo Nouvelle, and a bunch of others I don't think I'd heard of before."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds pretty solid, though yours is a bit heavy on techno for me."
"__MUSIC__ The more you listen on Spotify the better it gets. So if you listen to rock that is what will be in there."
"__MUSIC__ I listen to a lot of things though, what would happen then?"
"__MUSIC__ It will give you a mix of things based on how often you listen to each."
"__MUSIC__ That is pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ It's like having a friend with really good taste make you a mixtape every week."
"__MUSIC__ God I remember those, they were always fun."
"__MUSIC__ Well if you liked that you will love this."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I will have to try it."
