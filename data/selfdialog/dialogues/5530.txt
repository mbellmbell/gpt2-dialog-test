"__STAR_WARS__ So what do you think Luke will be like in the Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think he'll be very Yoda like.  All serious and stuff."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, I wish I saw more of him the The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would have been great."
"__STAR_WARS__ He has to be, other than Vader, the most dynamic character in the franchise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, from cry baby about power converters to Jedi Knight."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, a galaxy famous one who destroyed the first Death Star."
"__STAR_WARS__ And finally vanquished Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, all the Skywalker's power must be almost unstoppable."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know, I'm hoping to see some crazy things from him in the next movie."
