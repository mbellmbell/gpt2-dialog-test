"__POP__ So, what new pop music have you been listening to?"
"__POP__ Miley Cyrus has a good song that came out pretty recently. I think it is called 'Malibu.'"
"__POP__ I like that one too but I think my favorite new song is 'Something Just Like This' with The Chainsmokers and Coldplay."
"__POP__ That is a great song but nothing will ever be better than The Chainsmokers 'Selfie!'"
"__POP__ That was a great song. I think some of the greatest pop music came from the 90s."
"__POP__ You're right, I'll never forget Will Smith and 'Miami.'"
"__POP__ What about Aqua and 'Barbiegirl' and let's not ever forget about Sir MixaLot."
"__POP__ Baby Got Back, I'll never forget dancing to that when the parents were away. There was such a huge obsession with Savage Garden and Celine Dion too."
"__POP__ Yes, 'My Heart Will Go On' was everyone's favorite song for a while after Titanic. 'Peaches' was another favorite that was just huge for a while."
"__POP__ I wish we had something comparable now to what 'Peaches' was then. There is some great pop music being made but 'Peaches' was iconic."
