"__DISNEY__ Me and my sister were arguing the other day about what was the best Disney movie ever."
"__DISNEY__ What was your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ I said Bambi was the best Disney movie ever made. Everyone has seen and knows and loves that movie."
"__DISNEY__ It was really touching, and the animals were so cute."
"__DISNEY__ My sister said Cinderella was the best Disney movie ever. She said every little girl saw that movie and cheered for Cinderella and dreamed of meeting a Primce Charming like her."
"__DISNEY__ That's a tough one. I think Cinderella might be a little more better known than Bambi, just because the name is still mentioned when talking about evil stepmothers."
"__DISNEY__ So which Disney movie do you think is the best one ever made?"
"__DISNEY__ Actually, I always thought Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs was the best, because it was such an original plot, and I always loved those dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ I went online to see what other people ranked in top ten lists and stuff like that, hoping to break the tie. But all the lists kept mentioninng the same one as number one- The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ I think that's just because people think in two categories of Disney movies, the new ones, and the old classic ones. People voting The Lion King were obviously just thinking of the newer movies."
