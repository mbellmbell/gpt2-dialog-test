"__MOVIES__ Did you know that there will be a Pitch Perfect 3?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't hear that, that's awesome though!

"__MOVIES__ I thought so too! It looks like they're going to be going on a USO tour.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      pp"
"__MOVIES__ Oh that's really cool. I'm happy they're not trying to do another World Championship Of Acapella or something."
"__MOVIES__ Me too. I think that would be stretching the imagination to breaking."
"__MOVIES__ Is it most of the original cast?"
"__MOVIES__ From what I can tell online, yes."
"__MOVIES__ Is Rebel Wilson going to be in it again?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, she's definitely listed on the cast, along with Anna Kendrick."
"__MOVIES__ I love both of them so much. They are great actresses!"
"__MOVIES__ Anna Kendrick seems like she could be anyone's best friend, she's seems so normal."
"__MOVIES__ Do you follow her twitter?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I don't."
"__MOVIES__ You should, she posts a lot and she's really funny."
"__MOVIES__ I'll have to follow her the next time I log in."
"__MOVIES__ I heard that she's a pretty active Redditor too."
"__MOVIES__ I've heard that too. I can see the appeal of Reddit more than Twitter."
"__MOVIES__ Really? How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, unless she's posting pictures of herself or disclosing who she is, she gets to interact with all different types of people completely anonymously."
"__MOVIES__ Oh you're right, I can see why that would appeal to a celebrity."
