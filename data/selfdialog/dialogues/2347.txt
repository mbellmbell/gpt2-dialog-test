"__MUSIC__ What happened to people making music videos?"
"__MUSIC__ I think once YouTube came onto the scene it changed music."
"__MUSIC__ I remember how theater like they used to be."
"__MUSIC__ I know its something I looked forward to."
"__MUSIC__ Now it seems like bands just film videos of their concert."
"__MUSIC__ And play the track in the background."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I mean it seems wasteful"
"__MUSIC__ I dont know I still just listen for the music"
"__MUSIC__ Oh for sure but sometimes a good video sticks."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but the main importance is making good music."
"__MUSIC__ I think even bands with great followers cheat their fans."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ By not making a music video."
"__MUSIC__ I think you are in the minority on this one."
"__MUSIC__ I dont think so, its important."
"__MUSIC__ No as long as they tour fans are fine."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I can see your point."
"__MUSIC__ But I do wish MTV played music videos."
"__MUSIC__ They havent done that in 20 years."
"__MUSIC__ They mostly play the same reality shows nowadays."
