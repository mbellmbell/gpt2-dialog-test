"__ICEHOCKEY__ I think it will be this coming Saturday."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Awesome! You know what I love most about hockey?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No, dude. What would that be?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ When they slam into each other or into the sidelines & then burst into flames."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Oh yeah! And sometimes, a tire flies into the audience & takes out a couple spectators. That is so great!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Uh, I think you might be a tad bit confused. I'm talking about ice hockey - you're talking about drag racing."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yes sir! There's nothing North Carolina natives love more than hockey - especially when stuff blows up real good!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ You're talking about NASCAR, you nitwit!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I also like it when they release the lions. The hungrier the lions are, the more sport, eh?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Dude! ICE HOCKEY!! Guys on skates using sticks to knock a puck around! On the ICE!!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Heh! Now having the lions on skates - THAT would be extra cool! I am so there!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Okay. You're either seriously mistaken or hopelessly brain-damaged. I don't want to talk to you any more."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ The best part, though - the very best part - is when the English guy insults them for their bad singing!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ *whimpers*"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ No! After jumping all these hoops, only to have some smarmy Brit tell them that they stink! It's awesome!!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Please. Just go away. You are not the least bit funny or interesting."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I'd love to see THAT guy crash & burn or get eaten by a lion. Better yet, deal with a sword thrust, right in the gut! HA!!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Goodbye."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Hey! Don't go! I've got two tickets for baseball & a bag full of squid!"
