"__DISNEY__ I kind of wish they would remake Mulan with real people like they did for Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ That would be such a great remake!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree!  There are some great actors and actresses they could choose from."
"__DISNEY__ And think about the set if they were able to actually shoot in China!"
"__DISNEY__ The family's home and the Emperor's castle would look so cool."
"__DISNEY__ It definitely would.  Can you imagine what casting would be like though?"
"__DISNEY__ I'd love to see who they would cast as Chien-Po, Mulan's grandma, and her mom."
"__DISNEY__ How about Li Shang?  And Mulan herself?"
"__DISNEY__ Honestly, they could probably cast Lea Salonga as Mulan and she'd still be just as great as she was when she was the voice for the original."
"__DISNEY__ Agreed!"
