"__MUSIC__ So, what do you think of the new pretenders album?"
"__MUSIC__ pretenders?  Who are they? I think my parents liked them...."
"__MUSIC__ Really?  You've never heard 'middle of the road' or brass in pocket?  Back on the chain gang?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh, okay, now I know who you're talking about.  I haven't heard anything off the new album.  Is it on the radio?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so.  I was on their website and I saw they have a new album. There's a track called 'Holy Commotion'"
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of it?  Is it anything like their old songs?"
"__MUSIC__ It seems more produced than straight instruments. Almost like synthesized drums"
"__MUSIC__ Oh okay.  I don't like it when bands change styles"
"__MUSIC__ Me either, but Chrissy Hynde's voice is undeniable.  She still carries the same emotion in her vocals"
"__MUSIC__ Sounds cool.  Maybe I'll check it out. Can I see it on youtube?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. when I clicked on the link on the website, it took me there.  The video is set in a recording booth"
"__MUSIC__ I'll check it out.  Now those old songs are coming back to me.  They sang 'Don't get me wrong'"
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I love that one.  When I was on youtube, I started with the new video and ended up watching all the old ones"
"__MUSIC__ I do that too.  I'll start with one thing and end up in a completely different place"
"__MUSIC__ The video for 'back on the chain gang' was from when MTV used to be a music video channel"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah,  back when Men at Work and Duran Duran were popular.  Brings back memories...."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah!  who can it be now?  and I come from a land down under!"
"__MUSIC__ Her name is Rio and she dances in the sand!"
"__MUSIC__ Now I'm starting to feel old...  Check out the video and tell me what you think!"
"__MUSIC__ Sure thing.  Talk to you later...."
