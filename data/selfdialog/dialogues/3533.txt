"__MUSIC__ Hey who is your favorite band?"
"__MUSIC__ Right now I'm really into nothing more"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah they are great,  I love the song Jenny."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that's my favorite,  but it's really sad when you think about it."
"__MUSIC__ Really,  why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ The whole sing is about the singers mother and her dealing with her daughter's drug addiction while terminally ill."
"__MUSIC__ Dude, that is a bummer."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah but the band is really positive about helping people with mental issues because of it."
"__MUSIC__ That's cool,  what other music is similar?"
"__MUSIC__ Any alternative rock really,  as lions,  I prevail... all awesome."
"__MUSIC__ I prevail,  I've heard of them,  they covered Taylor swift didn't they?"
"__MUSIC__ Haha yeah don't even get me started on her."
"__MUSIC__ Why,  do you not like pop music?"
"__MUSIC__ I did,  but now it's all pretty repetative.  I like ed Sheeran though,  he's great."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah me too, I like the song he wrote for Lord of the rings."
"__MUSIC__ What's that called again? I know I've heard it."
"__MUSIC__ It's called I see fire."
"__MUSIC__ That's right,  it's really cool.  I like that he tries to do everything himself without a band."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he's really talented.   Like a current day michael Jackson."
"__MUSIC__ Wow... Just, no.  They are nothing alike,  don't ever compare them."
