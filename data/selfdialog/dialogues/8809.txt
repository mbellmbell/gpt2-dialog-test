"__BEATLES__ Who do you think is the best beatle?"
"__BEATLES__ John lennon I think without him they would never have gotten off the ground."
"__BEATLES__ That may be very true, but really any group is just that a group effort."
"__BEATLES__ yes, but Lennon was behind so much of the music's creation."
"__BEATLES__ I do agree somewhat. But I kind of see him as the one who broke the band up."
"__BEATLES__ I think that was more on Yoko."
"__BEATLES__ Oh please John was a grown up man and made the choices he made for himself ."
"__BEATLES__ But I think he was so in love with yoko he was swayed by her and his desire to be with her always."
"__BEATLES__ Perhaps. They did have that sit in at the hotel in Montreal. That was actually pretty cool."
"__BEATLES__ I think that was one of the most important stands he and yoko took together."
