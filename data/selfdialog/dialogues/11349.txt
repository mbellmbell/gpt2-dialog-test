"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I was looking at Fantasy Football strategy for this year and it's hard to tell who are the top running backs in the NFL this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I haven't looked at anything. I would guess that Ezekiel Elliott is the top running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's projected to be. Hard to not have big numbers behind that big offensive line and with the talent he has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wonder if he will go for 25 or more touchdowns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Possibly. That's one and a half a game. Pretty tough to do, but a game with three here and there, and possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm trying to think of more running backs. Wow, who else is still out there that produces. LeVeon Bell is the only other one that comes to mind."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ LeVeon Bell is definitely a big numbers producer. Especially if he's healthy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's had a hard time staying healthy. The Steelers run him to death."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They certainly do. He may not last another 3 or 4 years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Probably not. I can't think of any other running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is Jay Ajayi from Miami and David Johnson from Arizona."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would be a little wary of picking those two because they seem like one year wonders, especially on a team like Miami or Arizona."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Arizona running backs are usually fantasy busts."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, they are. Remember that running back they had a few years ago that everyone thought was the real deal and he flopped."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Andre Ellington, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, him. He was high on everyone's draft board."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He wouldn't be the first running back to be a waste of a pick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Certainly not. Who else is high on that list?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Jordan Howard is top ten."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The guy from the Bears?"
