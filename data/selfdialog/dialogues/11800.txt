"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think of the Cleveland Browns in the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Didn't Pat Schurmur, a former Michigan State Spartan, coach there a few years ago?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, actually, I met him in person at a dinner once."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's kind of cool. What did you think of him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a really nice guy, but I had no idea he was coaching the Cleveland Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seriously? That's funny."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I heard him talking about playing at Michigan State and then asked him what he did after college."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did you say??"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just said, I overheard him talking about playing football, and what was he doing now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And, what did he say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ 'I'm the coach of the Browns'.   I was so embarrassed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you wouldn't have known if he was coaching the Browns, since you don't live in Cleveland."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Later, I found out that the locals weren't that impressed, because the Browns weren't doing well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But how many people can say they met a head NFL Coach in person?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And, after a couple of years, he moved on become the Offensive coordinator and then interim head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, I heard that he's moved on again to the Minnesota Vikings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, I think that happened in 2016."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And, I hear he's now the Offensive Coordinator with the Vikings"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, It looks like he's definitely more comfortable being an offensive coordinator vs. the head coach."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, hopefully, he does well for the Vikings!"
