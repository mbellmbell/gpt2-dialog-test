"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Man, I'm bummed out cause I live with my parents and they won't allow me to listen to rap music."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Why not? It's not an inherently bad genre."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ They're super conservative Chrstians and think it would be a bad influence or something. So unless there's Christian artists out there..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ There actually are, like Tedashii, Lecrae, and Trip Lee just to name a few."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I wonder if that would be allowed."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't see why not. But really, secular rap isn't bad, it's just what you use it for that's bad."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well I wouldn't let it influence me negatively anyway."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It really doesn't have any power to influence you as long as you approach it with the mindset of you have to be discerning with it, unless your heart is already in a bad place and you actively want that music to encourage or grow that stuff in you. And even then it's not the music that's the problem."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Mind if I plagiarize that and use that to explain to them?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Not a bit, I hope it helps."
