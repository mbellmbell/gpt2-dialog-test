"__MOVIES__ I love movies about outer space, but I feel like I'm so behind on new movies!"
"__MOVIES__ You have a ton of movie watching to do then."
"__MOVIES__ What movie should I start with?"
"__MOVIES__ You should definitely start with Interstellar."
"__MOVIES__ Why should I start with that one?"
"__MOVIES__ It's a movie that just wows you at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'll have to take your word for it. What else?"
"__MOVIES__ You might like Gravity. I didn't like it that much, but if you like space, you'll like it."
"__MOVIES__ Why didn't you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ There just wasn't much dialogue. The visuals were really great though."
"__MOVIES__ I see. Any other good movies?"
"__MOVIES__ The Martian was great. I'm a big Matt Damon fan too and he's in that."
"__MOVIES__ What's that one about?"
"__MOVIES__ It's about an astronaut who is basically stranded on Mars."
"__MOVIES__ Is it a thriller then?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd say it's a mix between a thriller and a comedy."
"__MOVIES__ That sounds unique."
"__MOVIES__ It really is a great movie. Trust me on this one."
"__MOVIES__ Oh I will. When can we get together for movie night?"
"__MOVIES__ Let's do it next weekend!"
