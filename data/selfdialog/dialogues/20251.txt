"__MOVIES__ So, seen any good films lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I just recently saw Mrs Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Kids."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I've heard about that one... that's the one by Tim Burton, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, he directed it yet, but it's actually based on a series of books."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm... why does that sound familiar?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the books are all done in black and they've got bizarre, old fashioned pictures in them."
"__MOVIES__ You know, I think I saw one of those at the library once."
"__MOVIES__ You should pick them up, they're pretty good."
"__MOVIES__ Well, what did you think of the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I liked it... it's a LOT different than the books and in some ways that's good and some that's bad, but still."
"__MOVIES__ So, give me a summary, what's it about?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, this teenager, his grandfather, who told him a bunch of crazy stories as a kid, dies, and he finds out the story's are all true."
"__MOVIES__ What are the stories about?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm getting to that... the stories were about an island he was sent to full of 'special' children. Anyway, grandpa is killed in a rather mysterious way, so the boy follows clues and finds this ihouse on an island where 'peculiar' children live."
"__MOVIES__ And they're peculiar because they've got special powers and stuff?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's right.  One boy is invisible, another boy has bees living inside him, one girl burn things with her hands, and so on."
"__MOVIES__ Ahh.. kind of like X-Men for kids?"
"__MOVIES__ Weeeelll... that's a real bad comparison I'd say.  X-Men isn't the only series revolving around youngsters with odd abilities."
"__MOVIES__ So, what's the catch?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, the guys who killed the main boy's grandfather are trying to hunt down the other children."
