"__THRILLER__ I finally got around to seeing Inception yesterday."
"__THRILLER__ Oh yeah?  What did you think?"
"__THRILLER__ It was kind of confusing, but very cool to watch."
"__THRILLER__ All Christopher Nolan films are pretty awesome."
"__THRILLER__ So I don't really get the end.  What happened?"
"__THRILLER__ It's up to you to interpret it.  Maybe he's in a dream, maybe he's not."
"__THRILLER__ I think he never woke up.  That's why the top didn't stop spinning."
"__THRILLER__ But at the end, it nearly fell over."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, but it cut out so you'll never know."
"__THRILLER__ Right.  I guess that was the point."
