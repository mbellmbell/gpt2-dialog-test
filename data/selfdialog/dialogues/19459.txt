"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the new Fast and Furious movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, is it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, it is just more odd than anything else."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean odd?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Vin Diesel in now a bad guy."
"__MOVIES__ Really, how did that happen."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't want to ruin the movie for you, but he has his reasons I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Well, yeah, I probably will watch it eventually, so thanks for not spoiling it."
"__MOVIES__ That's no problem, but it's weird in other ways as well."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ Well Paul Walker is not in it, and he kind of was part of that to me."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, his passing was really sad, I hated to hear it."
"__MOVIES__ So did I, I think they really should have quit making these movies without him."
"__MOVIES__ Well I kind of feel that way as well."
"__MOVIES__ You just keep expecting him to pop in the movie and he is still alive."
"__MOVIES__ I can understand that, I mean they keep killing people in those movies and just bringing them back."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, what is up with that."
"__MOVIES__ I do not know, but it really is annoying."
"__MOVIES__ Anyway, it is a okay movie, you should go see it."
"__MOVIES__ I will I suppose, when I find the time."
