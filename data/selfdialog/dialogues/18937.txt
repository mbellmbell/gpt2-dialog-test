"__MOVIES__ Are you going to see the new Star Wars when it comes out?"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't see the first one."
"__MOVIES__ What?!"
"__MOVIES__ I heard a mixed review."
"__MOVIES__ It was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ I'll take you word for it."
"__MOVIES__ Did you like the originals?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah."
"__MOVIES__ So, what's the problem."
"__MOVIES__ The prequels."
"__MOVIES__ I kind of see your point, but this is an entirely different creature."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, just don't care for Lucas."
"__MOVIES__ He has gone down hill a bit, but I don't think he had much to do with the new ones."
"__MOVIES__ He owns it!"
"__MOVIES__ Nope. Sold to Disney."
"__MOVIES__ Oh! I had no idea!"
"__MOVIES__ So, gonna watch it now."
"__MOVIES__ I'll think on it."
"__MOVIES__ You have to, so you can come with me to the new one."
"__MOVIES__ Alright."
