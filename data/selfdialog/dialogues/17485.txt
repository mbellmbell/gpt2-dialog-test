"__MOVIES__ What is your favorite money-related film?"
"__MOVIES__ Interesting question. I would have to say The Wolf of Wall Street."
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed that movie. It could have been an hour shorter though."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed, but between Martin Scorsese's direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's acting, the film was close to a masterpiece."
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't go that far. Also, I much preferred Oliver Stone's Wall Street."
"__MOVIES__ While a good film, I found it too overt in its criticism of the financial sector."
"__MOVIES__ It was a bit overt, but I think it was attempting to portray the growth of the financial sector that was occurring at the time it was made."
"__MOVIES__ Did you ever the sequel made after the 2008 financial crisis?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it was terrible. I would contend that the sequel is one of Oliver Stone's worst films ever."
"__MOVIES__ Not JFK or Nixon?"
"__MOVIES__ I am kind of interested in conspiracy theories, so I really liked those films."
"__MOVIES__ Fair enough, my favorite Oliver Stone film would probably have to be Platoon."
"__MOVIES__ That was a great film, but I always preferred Full Metal Jacket to Platoon."
"__MOVIES__ Platoon is also really good. My favorite part was the drill sergeant played by R. Lee Ermey."
"__MOVIES__ He is such an underrated actor. I really liked when he played the police captain in Seven."
"__MOVIES__ Also an amazing film. Such a great performance by Kevin Spacey in that film."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed. There was like a five-year period in the 1990s where Kevin Spacey just made great movies."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. The Usual Suspects is my favorite crime movie of all time."
"__MOVIES__ Probably the high point of Stephen Baldwin's acting career."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I still can't believe that he followed up such a great film with Bio-Dome."
