"__DISNEY__ Did you hear they are making a new Incredibles movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes, I did.  I think the movies where Disney works with Pixar are the best."
"__DISNEY__ I think so too.  Finding Dory was great."
"__DISNEY__ I hope they continue making really good sequels for Disney movies. Sometimes kids movies have terrible sequels."
"__DISNEY__ I thought they did well with Monsters University."
"__DISNEY__ I liked that one too.  Cars 2 was terrible."
"__DISNEY__ They're making a new Cars movie too."
"__DISNEY__ Really?  I hope its better than the last one."
"__DISNEY__ The previews for it look pretty good but I think they've kind of beaten that one to death."
"__DISNEY__ I'll just wait until that one comes to dvd to see it."
