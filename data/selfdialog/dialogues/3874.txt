"__MUSIC__ What do you think about their new album Burning Bridges."
"__MUSIC__ Well I wouldn't call it new, it was 2015."
"__MUSIC__ True, but newest. I guess.  How do you like the new music compared to their 80's hits."

"__MUSIC__ That was a good one, I remember the videos were all over MTV at the time."
"__MUSIC__ They've been together a long time.  Most bands don't last this long."
"__MUSIC__ True, they've come a long way from the Slippery When Wet Album."
"__MUSIC__ Jon Bon Jovi never seems to age.  He's still just as handsome as ever."
"__MUSIC__ Richie Sambora on the other hand."
"__MUSIC__ Poor Richie, he's had a lot of bad road under him.  Lots of wives and drama.  I guess it would take it's toll on anyone."
"__MUSIC__ Well I guess he would probably respond to that in the words of another song of their's - It's My Life."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe so.  That was a pretty good album too, Crush.  It made a come back in the 2000."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, much to the delight of fans like myself.  Have you ever seen them live in concert."
