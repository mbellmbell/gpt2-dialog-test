"__BASEBALL__ Does Minor League baseball provide as much excitement as the Major Leagues?"
"__BASEBALL__ It depends on the type of baseball you like to watch."
"__BASEBALL__ I like to watch a game with a lot of real characters in it. It's great to root for a player with real personality."
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure that there are many great personalities playing in the Minor League."
"__BASEBALL__ But perhaps I will some rising stars?"
"__BASEBALL__ Absolutely. There have been many Rookie of the Year winners that have come up through the Minors."
"__BASEBALL__ Are the tickets cheaper?"
"__BASEBALL__ The tickets are significantly cheaper."
"__BASEBALL__ But then does that mean the players are paid less?"
"__BASEBALL__ The players are paid much less than in the Majors."
"__BASEBALL__ Perhaps I should try out and get a contract myself."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think you are good enough to play professionally?"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm not sure. I might not be fit enough for it."
"__BASEBALL__ Even in the Minor Leagues you have to be physically fit."
"__BASEBALL__ So are there any good games coming up that we can go to?"
"__BASEBALL__ I believe the Cyclones are playing the Renegades next week."
"__BASEBALL__ Will that be a good game?"
"__BASEBALL__ It could be. The Cyclones are one of the best teams out there."
"__BASEBALL__ Do you think they'll beat the Renegades?"
"__BASEBALL__ Perhaps. But then the Renegades are great too."
