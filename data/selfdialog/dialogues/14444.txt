"__HORROR__ What's a good horror movie to check out?"
"__HORROR__ If you haven't seen it, I'd recommend A Nightmare on Elm Street."
"__HORROR__ The one that came out in 2010?"
"__HORROR__ No, that is a remake and not nearly as good as the original. I'm talking about the one that was made in 1984."
"__HORROR__ Who is the main villain in that movie?"
"__HORROR__ His name is Freddy Krueger, he has a burnt face and wears a glove with knives on his fingers."
"__HORROR__ So he just walks around and stabs people with his knife fingers?"
"__HORROR__ Not exactly. He appears in people's dreams which if you think about it is pretty scary."
"__HORROR__ It's just a dream, what's scary about that?"
"__HORROR__ Because if he kills you in the dream, you die in real life. Also that fact that you have to sleep eventually so there is no escape from him."
