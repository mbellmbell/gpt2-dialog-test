"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they will replace Carrie Fisher in the next Star Wars Movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know who else could play Leia.  She passed so suddenly."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, they may have to remove Leia from the plot in the upcoming film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Perhaps they will kill off Leia in the next film, since Fisher is gone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Perhaps.  Do you think they might bring back Han Solo?"
"__STAR_WARS__ He was killed in 'The Force Awakens'."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, but is he really dead, or will there be a sci-fi 'resurrection'?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, but I wouldn't mind seeing Harrison Ford in the film."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me too, but Solo is the only character he could play."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes.  Perhaps he will after death like Yoda and Kenobi did at the end of 'Return of the Jedi'"
