"__MOVIES__ i was having a different thought"
"__MOVIES__ about what?"
"__MOVIES__ i was thinking instead of going to the pub why not we get a drink and buy 2 or 3 dvd and come watch at home."
"__MOVIES__ hmm that's not a bad idea,would also see what Fred thinks about it."
"__MOVIES__ ok please do and let me know."
"__MOVIES__ i'll, but this all depends on what we would all agree to watch."
"__MOVIES__ that's true though, with so many movies out this summer one is spoil with so many choices and this might differ to individuals."
"__MOVIES__ nonetheless though we can all come to a concession."
"__MOVIES__ true, let's see how it goes."
"__MOVIES__ we can start by listing 5 possible movies and see if 3 of us can agree on 1 of the suggested."
"__MOVIES__ hmm,trendy movies right now is 'Tanker' 'Count Me' 'The Mummy' 'Baby Driver' 'Kong: Skull Island'"
"__MOVIES__ and which is your most preferable?"
"__MOVIES__ it should be 'Kong: Skull Island' its the most talked about movie at the moment."
"__MOVIES__ and that's the same movie i was contemplating to choose myself, i was checking the reviews in between and true its nothing but positive reviews."
"__MOVIES__ i only have seen a little teaser before it was officially released and seems action packed."
"__MOVIES__ it all boils down now to Fred if he would also love the idea to skip pub and also watch 'Kong'"
"__MOVIES__ just hold on a bit let me just fill him in about the new arrangement. be right back."
"__MOVIES__ alright then,i was to see him in couple of hours so would have explain to him in person then."
"__MOVIES__ in that case i'll chill and let you hint him the new plan and what his take is."
"__MOVIES__ sure, very possible we might even drop by your place."
