"__MOVIES__ What movie did you guys go see last night?"
"__MOVIES__ Unfortunately we went to see The Mummy."
"__MOVIES__ Why unfortunately? It looked good."
"__MOVIES__ It was terrible.  I expected it to be as good as the Brendon Fraiser movies."
"__MOVIES__ It has Tom Cruise man, he's great in everything."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know what it was about the movie, it was just boring."
"__MOVIES__ The action wasn't good?"
"__MOVIES__ There was some good Tom Cruise-esque action, but besides that it was just dull."
"__MOVIES__ How so?"
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?  The characters were just dull and weren't very believable."
"__MOVIES__ I think you're just letting your Brendon Fraiser fandom skew your perception."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe, he is my favorite actor."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't watched many of his movies, what do you recommend?"
"__MOVIES__ All of them.  But seriously, Encino man and blast from the past are great."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen them yet, any more?"
"__MOVIES__ I'd watch those two and Dudley Do Right and let me know what you think."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, bring your copies tomorrow so I can watch them."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, don't lose them though."
"__MOVIES__ I won't man, I never do."
"__MOVIES__ Alright, I'll see you tomorrow."
