"__FASHION__ Who do you think was the best dressed James Bond?"
"__FASHION__ Wow, that's a tough one.  However, I would go with Thunderball the midnight blue dinner jacket he wore was a very classic look."
"__FASHION__ Fine, any other favorite Bond outfits?"
"__FASHION__ In Skyfall Daniel Craig wore a shawl collar jacket that while stylish worked well with the darker tones of the movie."
"__FASHION__ There have also been some pretty badly dressed characters in the movies though."
"__FASHION__ Yes indeed, at least every film set in warm weather seems to feature someone with a mismatched tropical outfit of some kind."
"__FASHION__ Bond sure has evolved his style over the years."
"__FASHION__ It's been interesting he's worn everything from ivory jackets to tweed."
"__FASHION__ I feel like a lot of men like to sometimes copy his style don't you think?"
"__FASHION__ Definitely would agree with that, many of my friends have worn a peacoat or in the summer tried the shorter swim trunks popular after Casino Royale."
"__FASHION__ I must say some of the villains have had some interesting style choices as well."
"__FASHION__ Hugo Drax in moonraker had an intresting style with the all caramel colored jacket."
"__FASHION__ Fashion usually says a lot about the villains, I usually can tell what their motives are by their outfit."
"__FASHION__ Not necessarily true, a lot of them of been disguised in everything from spacesuits to old 1940's ear maid outfits."
"__FASHION__ What would you tell someone who wanted to copy just a single item form Bond's style?"
"__FASHION__ The black tuxedo in any cut that's modern really goes a long way."
"__FASHION__ Bond also often wears a bow tie and not a tie I always wondered why not a tie?"
"__FASHION__ Probably because the tie would clash with the outfit a lot and the bow tie is a subtle and unique fashion statement."
"__FASHION__ I also really like the outfits the ladies of Bond wear which one is your favorite?"
"__FASHION__ The original bond girl of course! Ursula Andress, and her white bikini she looks beautiful!"
