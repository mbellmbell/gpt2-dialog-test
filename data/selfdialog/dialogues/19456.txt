"__MOVIES__ I'm so psyched about that new Aquaman movie."
"__MOVIES__ I am, too! What's the release date?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently it's December 2018."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't there also a Justice League movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. They actually wanted to make that before finishing Aquaman."
"__MOVIES__ Which superheroes are supposed to be in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Apparently it has Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and some others."
"__MOVIES__ Which others?"
"__MOVIES__ They're not as well known. I think it has Cyborg, Steppenwolf and Lex Luthor."
"__MOVIES__ Lex Luthor. He sounds familiar."
"__MOVIES__ He's a supervillain, actually. He has been around in comics for a long time."
"__MOVIES__ I think I remember hearing about him in those older Superman movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I think he was in the series that had Christopher Reeve in it."
"__MOVIES__ Cool. Who played him?"
"__MOVIES__ That was Gene Hackman, actually."
"__MOVIES__ I remember those movies. They were nothing like the superhero movies they make nowadays."
"__MOVIES__ That's true. There have been some big changes in things like the costumes and special effects."
"__MOVIES__ I wonder what led to the changes."
"__MOVIES__ I know that a lot of people say that the Batman movie with Michael Keaton was when a lot of that stuff started to change."
"__MOVIES__ I love that movie!"
