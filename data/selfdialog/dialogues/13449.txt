"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've had something in my mind regarding the future of the NFL"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What is it?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After guys like Brady, Brees, Rodgers and Big Ben retire who do you think will be the top guys at the position?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it's hard to say. Mostly because I don't think Brady is ever going to retire. Second, I don't know the future of the upcoming quarterbacks for the draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. Hard to judge the future of the position when there will be 20 or 30 new quarterbacks drafted by the time they are all gone."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ To answer your question. I think it might be someone like Dak or Russell Wilson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Carr?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah definitely Carr. I think I might have to edit my answer. I forgot about him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Cousins could ever hit that tier?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm really not sure. His Win/Loss record against good teams isn't that impressive."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The 'Skins don't seem to be too faithful in him. They keep dangling him on one year deals."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose with good reason. He still needs to play better in big games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Newton? You don't think he can take over the league?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He could, but I find his style of play to be too physical to maintain."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I find he is kind of like a worse version of Big Ben. Cam's more athletic, but his accuracy and decision making is a lot worse."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah definitely. Even with a poor offensive line Big Ben still plays amazingly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Cam may make a few more Pro-Bowls, but outside of that I don't think he will dominate."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ His career hasn't been as good as people say it has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is crazy to think we are in the brink of a generation change at the quarterback position."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I always fear we will hit a wall where there's no legitimately great ones in the league, but looks like we have plenty of candidates for the future."
