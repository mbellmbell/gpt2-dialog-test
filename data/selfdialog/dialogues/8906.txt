"__BEATLES__ Hey, did you know Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings?"
"__BEATLES__ Um...yeah...the Beatles. One of the most classic bands of all times."
"__BEATLES__ I like some of their stuff, like Help and Love Me Do. Very catchy."
"__BEATLES__ Dig deeper. Eleanor Rigby is a good one, so is Norwegian Wood. Some of their lesser known songs, in my opinion, are better."
"__BEATLES__ What is your favorite song of theirs?"
"__BEATLES__ Let It Be, or Norwegian Wood. So many to choose from!"
"__BEATLES__ Where should I start getting into the music?"
"__BEATLES__ Abbey Road is good. The White Album, maybe, or a greatest hits album."
"__BEATLES__ Thanks. I'll check it out."
"__BEATLES__ Cool."
