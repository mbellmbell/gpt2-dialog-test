"__MOVIES__ Comedies are what I love as well. What is your favorite movie?"

"__MOVIES__ He is one of mine as well, every film he does always cracks me up"
"__MOVIES__ Tell me about it! I could watch his movies all day and not get bored."
"__MOVIES__ I loved Anchor man; so many funny parts in that one!"
"__MOVIES__ That is an awesome movie, I love when he is fighting with his co-anchor."
"__MOVIES__ Yea those scenes are comedy gold, and they never get old whatsoever."
"__MOVIES__ I also love all of his interactions with Vince Vaughn in the film."
"__MOVIES__ Yea those are priceless! I wished those two would do more movies together!"
"__MOVIES__ I agree with you there, those two really play off of each other very well."

"__MOVIES__ Yes, I actually bought the DVD the first day it was released."
"__MOVIES__ I dont have the DVD, but I did go see it  with my brother at the theater. We both loved it!"
"__MOVIES__ I think I have probably watched it about twenty times by now."
"__MOVIES__ I did not like it as much as I did the first one though. It was funny and all, just not the same to me as the original."
"__MOVIES__ They are very close to me, but I agree the first one was a little better."
"__MOVIES__ Sequels hardly ever live up to the hype of the first movie in my opinion."
"__MOVIES__ That is very true! I truly enjoy both of them though."
