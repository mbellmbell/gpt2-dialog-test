"__MUSIC__ Hey, you know who I've been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ Who?"
"__MUSIC__ Cyndi Lauper!  I love her music."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I love her too!  She kinda reminds me of Madonna."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but their music is different."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know.  They both were female pop artists from the same time period."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, true.  Well Do you remember her True Colors album?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course!  I loved that album."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  And Girls Just Wanna Have Fun was the best."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah that was one of my favorites."
"__MUSIC__ She did the soundtrack for The Goonies, did you know that?"
"__MUSIC__ No, but I know she got a Best New Artist Grammy award in 1985.  I remember seeing it!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow.  That's totally unsurprising though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  I don't think she had the same level of fame as Madonna though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Madonna was probably more popular."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  Girls Just Wanna Have Fun was supposedly one of the best videos of its time though."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and Cyndi Lauper did win an incredible amount of awards."
"__MUSIC__ It's possible that they are neck and neck for fame."
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like Madonna's music better, but I do love Cyndi Lauper too."
"__MUSIC__ I guess I agree.  I would pick Madonna too."
