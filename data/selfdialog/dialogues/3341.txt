"__MUSIC__ I went to the James Taylor/Carole King concert last night."
"__MUSIC__ How was it? I couldn't make it."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, it was really great. I've seen James Taylor a few times before this, but never Carole King."
"__MUSIC__ I've never seen her either. What did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I enjoyed her a lot more than I expected. She did some of her hits and some old Goffin and King songs."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I think I would enjoy that."
"__MUSIC__ The chemistry between them was great."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that makes sense. They are old friends."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, they are. You know how James Taylor always seems so warm and accessible in his concerts?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes."
"__MUSIC__ Well, she is the same way. It felt like an evening spent chatting with the two of them and 10,000 fans."
"__MUSIC__ What songs did he do?"
"__MUSIC__ He did some that you would expect like Walking Man, Carolina in my Mind and Fire and Rain."
"__MUSIC__ What else?"
"__MUSIC__ He did Sweet Baby James and he told a story about writing that song for his baby nephew. I was glad to hear that, because I always thought it was odd to write that about himself."
"__MUSIC__ I always thought that, too. Did he do any more obscure songs?"
"__MUSIC__ He did. He did that Millworker song tha tI really love."
"__MUSIC__ I love that, too. Did he do Steamroller?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, he did. I have really never liked that song for some reason."
"__MUSIC__ Really? I love it."
