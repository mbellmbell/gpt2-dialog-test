"__MOVIES__ Have you seen any good comedies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ A couple of weeks ago I saw 'Yes Man' again with my wife. Hilarious!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah. That movie is very good."
"__MOVIES__ But other than that I haven't liked any of the comedy movies that have been put out lately."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah. I've had a really hard time finding a good one."
"__MOVIES__ They are all so rude and immoral that I don't even laugh once."
"__MOVIES__ Happens to me to."
"__MOVIES__ You know, Jim Carrey should do some more movies like his old ones: 'Liar Liar', 'The Mask'."
"__MOVIES__ He should. But I heard that right now he is not so much into acting, but in other projects in his life."
"__MOVIES__ Really? That's strange to hear."
"__MOVIES__ Well, people want to mix things up. He wants to experiment with new things."
"__MOVIES__ But was he still going to be in the movie industry?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes. He was trying directing, producing and that kind of stuff, if I remember correctly."
"__MOVIES__ Well, we should see the movies he directs or produces. Maybe they'll be funny."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if they are going to be strictly comedies. You know he has experimented a lot with dramas too."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. Well we'll have to wait and read about the movies he'll be participating in then."
"__MOVIES__ Mean while, we'll have to re-watch any of his old ones."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. My wife and I laughed just as hard as the first time with 'Yes Man'."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe I'll see 'Dumb and Dumber'."
"__MOVIES__ Classic. One of these days I'll probably watch it again too."
