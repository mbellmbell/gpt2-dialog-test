"__POP__ How do you like Avril Lavigne?"
"__POP__ I really like her, listening to her album I can almost feel her progression in life as a human being."
"__POP__ I feel the same, she's such a great singer, and she creates those music with her souls"
"__POP__ I think that's the magic that makes her songs attactive, isn't it?"
"__POP__ I can't agree more, I listen to her albums from Let Go to Goodbye Lullaby"
"__POP__ oh, you know her song from Goodbye Lullaby was featured as the main theme music of Alice in Wonderland?"
"__POP__ yeah, I recognized her voice immediately after I hearing the music"
"__POP__ it's great, isn't it? But it's also kinda, I don't know sad? to see her away from her street punk style music"
"__POP__ yea, she's married and definitely more mature now, but I do miss her old style, simply cool and careless, the feeling of letting go"
"__POP__ i agree"
