"__SUPERHERO__ What's your least favorite Marvel movie?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'd have to say Elektra with Jennifer Garner"
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh I heard that was bad. I wonder if she hated playing that role."
"__SUPERHERO__ I doubt it. Who wouldn't love playing a superhero?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I agree. My least favorite would have to be Daredevil with Ben Affleck."
"__SUPERHERO__ I've never seen that one. Was it that bad?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Worse. Luckily he redeemed himself playing Batman."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yes definitely. Batman vs Superman was a fantastic movie. I've seen it three times."
"__SUPERHERO__ It was great and I loved the cameos of the other DC characters, building up to The Justice League."
"__SUPERHERO__ Oh you know every DC fan was geeking out when they saw that."
