"__HORROR__ Where would you put The Conjuring on your list of best horror films of all time?"
"__HORROR__ Nowhere near that list."
"__HORROR__ Oh geez why do you say that?"
"__HORROR__ Because there was nothing scary about that movie."
"__HORROR__ I beg to differ and so do alot of movies."
"__HORROR__ OK well the list is subjective."
"__HORROR__ So what is on your list."
"__HORROR__ The top film of all time would be The Shining."
"__HORROR__ OK I guess I know where this is headed."
"__HORROR__ You can say that but many more people will say its number one than say The Conjuring is even good."
