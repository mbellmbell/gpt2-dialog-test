"__ROCK__ Absolutely loving the new EP from The Scandals, have you heard it?"
"__ROCK__ No I haven't, I didn't even know they put out a new one."
"__ROCK__ Oh man you're going to love it, it's produced by Brian Fallon."
"__ROCK__ Wait, you mean the Brian Fallon, of The Gaslight Anthem?"
"__ROCK__ You bet, his DNA is all over it, sounds like old Gaslight."
"__ROCK__ Oh my god I can't wait to hear this now."
"__ROCK__ Yep, Brian Fallon dipping his toes back into punk after Painkillers is a treat."
"__ROCK__ Though is it just going to make me miss Gaslight?"
"__ROCK__ It might, but it might also make you feel okay that The Scandals can fill that void."
"__ROCK__ Very excited now, Jared Hart has a great voice."
