"__HARRY_POTTER__ I'm pretty sure Voldemort has some nice qualities to him."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ You're insane."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hear me out.  He had a bad childhood, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He was an orphan, right?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Right."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, Harry was the same way so why does he get a free pass?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Because Harry was never evil at heart."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ But maybe Voldemort wasn't either when he was very young."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, Voldemort's dead, so end of discussion."
