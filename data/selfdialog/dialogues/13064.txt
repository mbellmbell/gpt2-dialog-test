"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So, how many wins will the Jets have?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might not get any."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. They are clearly tanking for next year's draft."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If you're going to start Christian Hackenberg at quarterback, that's the only possible message."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep. And there's no one to throw to, with Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall gone now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding. Who could they beat?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Browns. Maybe. Perhaps the Bills on a really good day. Otherwise, I can't see a winnable game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, they're probably going to be picked to lose every game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That seems like it'd be fine for them, what with teh 'Suck for Sam' campaign"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There lies the silver lining: At least 2017 will end and they'll get a shot at a good QB for 2018."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But would San Darnold be the answer, if they land him?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I dunno. USC quarterbacks like Matt Leinart and Mark Sanchez have not translated well to NFL success, but Darnold is pretty good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's IF he comes out. He may end up staying into the 2018 college season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But that's the advantage for the 2018 draft. Ther's Josh Rosen, Josh Allen, Mason Rudolph - a lot of QB options."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This is the Jets, though. They'll screw it up."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. They have been without a franchise quarterback since ... well, Joe Namath, really."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Goodness, has it been that long? I can't take any more of watching these guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One more terrible season, then it should begin to swing upward, my friend."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so. I'm already dreading Sundays this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Could be worse. We could be Browns fans."
