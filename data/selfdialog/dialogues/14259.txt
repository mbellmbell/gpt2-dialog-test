"__HORROR__ You've seen Psycho right?"
"__HORROR__ Only the remake, wasn't it mostly shot for shot anyway?"
"__HORROR__ It was, but there's something about the black and white that adds to the suspense and while I like Vince Vaughn, he's no Anthony Perkins."
"__HORROR__ I'll have to watch it, I do enjoy old horror movies."
"__HORROR__ Oh you will undoubtedly love it, then you will want to watch the sequels, won't get enough of Normon Bates."
"__HORROR__ I'm pretty excited, maybe I'll watch this Saturday evening."
"__HORROR__ Let me know if you do, I'll catch it again. Another one you should check out would be Black Christmas."
"__HORROR__ Haven't seen it either, but I hear it influenced Halloween."
"__HORROR__ Oh it sure did, without it John Carpenter may have never had the inspiration."
"__HORROR__ Wow a world with no Michael Myers, thanks Black Christmas!"
