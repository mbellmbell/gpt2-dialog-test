"__BASEBALL__ Yep,it sure is. I think that is baseball at its best."

"__BASEBALL__ I saw the Chicago Cubs play the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals play the White Sox."
"__BASEBALL__ Great fun.So who won?"
"__BASEBALL__ Uh, actually I don't remember. I follow the Detroit Tigers mostly,so I really wasn't rooting much for one over the other."

"__BASEBALL__ Talked with my sister; ate hot dogs; played on my iphone; got some sun."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, speaking of the Tigers... you want to go to a game with me this fall?"
"__BASEBALL__ Sure, that would be fun. Shall we get a group together, or just the two of us?"
