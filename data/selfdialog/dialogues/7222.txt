"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like Lady Gaga's newer stuff?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ I think so. I actually don't know her new album at all though. What's it called?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Joanne."
"__LADY_GAGA__ That's her real name, isn't it."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, it is. Have you heard her song Million Reasons?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes! Is that on the newest album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah! I like how deep it is."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, it's a good song. But Paparazzi will always define her to me."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Well, of course! And Poker Face."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yes! The Fame is such a fantastic album all the way around."
