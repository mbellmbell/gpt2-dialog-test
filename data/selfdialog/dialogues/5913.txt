"__STAR_WARS__ Rey's imagination bothers me."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why?"
"__STAR_WARS__ She's flying to a planet with Han and Chewie and says 'I didn't know there was this much green in the galaxy'"
"__STAR_WARS__ So?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, clearly she'd have known there are endless planets."
"__STAR_WARS__ You think it's a character weakness that she thinks this one planet has more green than any other?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, do you have a better idea?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Of course."
"__STAR_WARS__ Let's hear it."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's a metaphor. She's from a desert. Get over it."
