"__DISNEY__ So did you know the first Disney movie came out 80 years ago?"
"__DISNEY__ No.  Which one was it?"
"__DISNEY__ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ Don't you mean dwarves?"
"__DISNEY__ No.  It is dwarfs."
"__DISNEY__ Dwarfs?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes.  The term dwarves was actually coined by Tolkien, you know The Hobbit etc., about 80 years ago as well.  He said it gave his dwarves a dignity that regular dwarfs could hardly attain."
"__DISNEY__ So Sneezy and Dopey were not dignified?"
"__DISNEY__ I guess not.  But they have sure been glorified.  Have you seen the outside of the Disney building?  The dwarfs are featured sculptures."
"__DISNEY__ Well, I guess there is dignity in that.  I think it might be time for me to watch that movie again.  I cannot believe it has been eighty years since it was created."
