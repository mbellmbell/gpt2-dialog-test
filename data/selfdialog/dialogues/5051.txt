"__FAST_FURIOUS__ What do you think of the upcoming Fate of the Furious?"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Personally I can't believe they are doing an 8th film."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know right? I mean I'm all for a movie about cars, and racing them, but come on!"
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ I know right? Its kind of completely lost its touch."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ It's like the entire movie has forgotten the reason why the movie was put together in the first place."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Right? The movie just needs to go back to the basics, fast cars, fast women, and good times."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ At least they still have most of the original characters."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea, my favorite is Dom, I'm really wondering what is up with him in this latest movie tho."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea it really looks like he's going to be a bad guy."
"__FAST_FURIOUS__ Yea what do you think that's all about?"
