"__MOVIES__ Have you watched any good horror movies of late?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, I did recently catch this movie called Split, but I'm not sure if you'd categorize it as horror."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I caught that, the M. Night Shyamalan movie with James McAvoy."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah that one, I thought it was really good!"
"__MOVIES__ What was your favorite thing about that movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I enjoyed the mystery it presented, with all the personalities that James was cycling through, you never knew what to expect next."
"__MOVIES__ I thought he did an amazing job, and the movie definitely kept me in suspense. I didn't know what was going to happen to the captives."
"__MOVIES__ I was expecting a typical cliche horror movie, but it turned out to be so much more."
"__MOVIES__ I kept waiting for the twist to happen like in all M. Night movies, but I don't think there really was one other than maybe the beast reveal?"
"__MOVIES__ That wasn't really a twist in the movie, I don't think, it was presented to us throughout, the fact of it being present was there, but we just didn't know if it was going to be true or not."
"__MOVIES__ You're right, I did expect the 'beast' to be real, since it is an M. Night movie, but I really liked the way they kept us guessing up to the end."
"__MOVIES__ I didn't think it was going to be real, I thought for sure, it was going to be just another personality and not a full on, supernatural thing."
"__MOVIES__ Did knowing that throw you off about the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh it definitely throw me off about the movie, I think I enjoyed it more, then when they showed Bruce in the closing scene, I was mind blown!"
"__MOVIES__ That was really something else! I loved the fact that this movie ties in with his previous one! Didn't see that coming!"
"__MOVIES__ M. Night is essentially creating his own Superhero Universe if you think about it!"
"__MOVIES__ That's true, now I'm hoping there's a follow up to this so that it'll somewhat complete his trilogy!"
"__MOVIES__ I read somewhere that this movie is definitely a follow up and there is going to be another one just as you wanted!"
"__MOVIES__ That's fantastic! If it's anything like Split, I think I'm there opening night!"
"__MOVIES__ Count me in, I'm sold!"
