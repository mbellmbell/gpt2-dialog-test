"__ICEHOCKEY__ Did you see the match between the Sharks and the Oilers?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea it was pretty close game with overtime!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Sharks won 3-2."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Totally agree. Melker Karlsson's wrist-shot goal at 3:22 of overtime gave the San Jose Sharks a win."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That was crazy! Let's look at some statistics."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Ok, well Cam Talbot made 41 saves for the Oilers."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ While Sharks goalie Martin Jones stopped 17 shots, most of them in the first period."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ For sure! Paul Martin and Joel Ward scored in regulation for the Sharks"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yup, while Oscar Klefbom and Milan Lucic scored for the Oilers."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What about the Blues vs Wild game?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That was a great game as well!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Goalie Jake Allen had a season-high 51 saves."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ He is so good!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I agree completely. What about Sobotka?"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Vladimir Sobotka scored in regulation for the St. Louis Blues, giving them a 1-0 lead in their best-of-seven series against Minnesota."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ What was crazy was the Blues were less than a minute from winning in regulation, but Wild left winger Zach Parise's goal with 22.7 seconds left."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ Yea! This forged a tie after Minnesota's first 43 shots had been turned aside by Allen."
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I am still thinking about that game!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ I also watched the Penguins vs Blue Jackets game. So good!"
"__ICEHOCKEY__ That was a good game with the Penguins having a 3-0 lead in the second period with goals from Bryan Rust, Phil Kessel and Nick Bonino. Evgeni Malkin added two assists which was crazy."
