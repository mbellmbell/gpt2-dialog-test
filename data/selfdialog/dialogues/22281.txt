"__DISNEY__ What's you favourite Disney film?"
"__DISNEY__ Probably Robin Hood, I like the animals."
"__DISNEY__ Really? It's alright I guess."
"__DISNEY__ What! Only alright. The opening theme song is one of the greatest of all time and Maid Marion is an absolute babe."
"__DISNEY__ Wasn't she a fox."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah she was one foxy lady."
"__DISNEY__ That's pretty weird mate."
"__DISNEY__ What, so Robin Hood can fancy her but I can't?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, because he was also an animated fox and you're, apparently, a legitimate human being."
"__DISNEY__ If you say so, but it feels like double standards."
