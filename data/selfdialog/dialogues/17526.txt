"__MOVIES__ I always tease my sister about this part of The Lord of the Rings: Two Towers."
"__MOVIES__ Which part?"
"__MOVIES__ The part when Legolas misses the torch running orc."
"__MOVIES__ Which scene is that? I don't remember exactly."
"__MOVIES__ You know. The scene where Aragorn and the group gather to defend Rohan from the orc army."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that part. Legolas was under a lot of pressure in that scene. Aragorn was yelling at him an all."
"__MOVIES__ That's the excuse my sister uses. That and bad writing."
"__MOVIES__ Legolas managed to hit that orc once, though."
"__MOVIES__ In the shoulder and it was too late to stop it by then."
"__MOVIES__ You just don't like that elf."
"__MOVIES__ He wasn't my favorite character in the movies. My favorite character was killed off in Fellowship of the Ring."
"__MOVIES__ Gandolf?"
"__MOVIES__ No, silly. Boromir."
"__MOVIES__ The guy that attacked Frodo over the ring?"
"__MOVIES__ He came to his senses after that."
"__MOVIES__ I have to give the guy props for lasting as long as he did with all those arrows in him."
"__MOVIES__ That's why I like his character the most. He put up a good fight."
"__MOVIES__ What about his brother, Faramir?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't think he was as tough as Boromir."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe not."
