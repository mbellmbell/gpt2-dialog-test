"__ACTION__ Whats your favorite mafia action movie?"
"__ACTION__ Wow that's a good question. I would have to say Donnie Brasco."
"__ACTION__ I love that movie! There's some intense parts in it."
"__ACTION__ Yeah like how they chop the guys up in the basement."
"__ACTION__ Did you know that it is based on a true story?"
"__ACTION__ Wow, that's pretty messed up."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, it is hard to believe how ruthless the mafia was."
"__ACTION__ It is probably the reason why the mafia fell apart."
"__ACTION__ I agree, they associated with too many killers, even though they were mainly about business."
"__ACTION__ It's a good thing that kind of stuff is illegal or they would control everything."
