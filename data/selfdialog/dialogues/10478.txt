"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So who do you like better, the old Kanye, or the new Kanye?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The old Kanye, hand's down. The College Dropout and Graduation are classics."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I completely agree, I'm still in awe at how amazing 'Through the Wire' was. He rapped that with his jaw wired shut!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Right? And honestly I still listen to 'The New Workout Plan' every time I go for a run."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So did you not like his new stuff at all?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh no, I just prefer the old Kanye, but I did really like 'Life of Pablo.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I did too, and you know what's funny? The song 'I Love Kanye' where he raps 'I miss the old Kanye.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Hahaha! 'I miss the old Kanye, straight from the go Kanye.'"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ 'Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye.' But can we both agree 'Yeezus' was one of the worst albums of all time?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh I don't know about that ... I really liked BLKKK SKKKN HEAD."
