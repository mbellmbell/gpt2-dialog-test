"__MOVIES__ Did you see the new Guardians movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I have not yet did you like it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was amazing. Really brought him into the Marvel universe."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Don't you think that marvel universe, as far as movies go, is got out of hand."
"__MOVIES__ No, It a huge franchise.I mean look at the whole Xmen set of movies, you like them right?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked the first xmen movies.The older ones not the new ones."
"__MOVIES__ You did not like the Days of Future past?"
"__MOVIES__ I did not, it was too pushed and kind of silly. I am into the Avengers though."
"__MOVIES__ All the stand alone ones or just the Avengers movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I liked them all.The Avengers and their adventures, what is you favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ I have to go with the second Avengers, how about you?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh man. No way, Avengers the first one always the best."
"__MOVIES__ Really? Did you like they way the action was sequenced in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ I did. I thought it was a bit over the top sometimes, but the actin matched the story line well."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, no I like a lot of action. I mean come on , hulk was like a baby in most of the first one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but he was on purpose. You think they will make him more wild in the new Thor?"
"__MOVIES__ I sure hope so. I am looking forward to seeing the new Thor."
"__MOVIES__ I am too. I heard it is supposed to be really dark."
"__MOVIES__ I did not hear that. Maybe they will lighten it up, like the first Captain America movie."
"__MOVIES__ I hope so, that one got dark in the second movie as well."
