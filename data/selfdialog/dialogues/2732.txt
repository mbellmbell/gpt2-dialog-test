"__MUSIC__ Remember that duo from Europe?"
"__MUSIC__ Which duo from Europe? Europe is a big country."
"__MUSIC__ Shut up. You know those black dudes with hair extensions, caught not singing their own songs or something."
"__MUSIC__ Milli Vanilli."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah! Which one was Milli and which was Vanilli?"
"__MUSIC__ i don't think that's how they worked."
"__MUSIC__ Anyway, whatever happened to them?"
"__MUSIC__ They tried to sing in front of camera once they got busted, and they were both tone deafs."
"__MUSIC__ Hahaha. That's so funny."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they were from Germany. They can't really sing in English"
"__MUSIC__ But how come they thought they coudl pull it off? it's just so stupid."
"__MUSIC__ Well, one they got the record out and videos made, it just came down to the tours, and they were just lip syncing in the live performances"
"__MUSIC__ That never goes over well."
"__MUSIC__ No. so rumors started flying around that they're not the actual recording artists, blah blah."
"__MUSIC__ And they weren't"
"__MUSIC__ Nope. It was some fat black guy who was the main vocal. he couldn't really sing that well either."
"__MUSIC__ So they were forced to admit they weren't the real singers? Milli Vanilli, I mean"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. On camera during a show. it was hilarious. That's how bad their singing was."
"__MUSIC__ Didn't they have to give up their grammy?"
"__MUSIC__ They were stripped of it, yes. Ah, the hilarity of the 80s."
