"__MOVIES__ The Departed is my favorite movie about Boston."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that movie is kind of dark, right?"
"__MOVIES__ It is! But the setting and the accents and the whole vibe is really great."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't Matt Damon in it?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he plays a bad cop. It's kind of complicated."
"__MOVIES__ That's right. It's about the crime world in South Boston."
"__MOVIES__ It is. I think it provides a good feel for the culture of the city though."
"__MOVIES__ Did they actually shoot it there?"
"__MOVIES__ I believe so. There are some landmarks in it anyway."
"__MOVIES__ Was Ben Affleck in it? He does a lot of Boston movies, right?"
"__MOVIES__ He's not in this one. I think you might be thinking of The Town."
"__MOVIES__ Oh ok. Yeah, there's that one along with Gone Baby Gone."
"__MOVIES__ I guess Ben is a Boston boy at heart. He loves that city."
"__MOVIES__ And don't forget about Good Will Hunting."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah. That's the one he did with Matt Damon."
"__MOVIES__ The two of them wrote the screenplay for it."
"__MOVIES__ I haven't seen that movie in a while. It came out in the 90's right?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely. It's almost a classic at this point."
"__MOVIES__ I should catch up on it. We should have a Boston movie marathon!"
"__MOVIES__ Of course! There are so many to choose from."
