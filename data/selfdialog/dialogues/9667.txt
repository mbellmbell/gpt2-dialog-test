"__COMEDY__ One of my favorite comedies was this outrageous puppet movie called Team America : World Police. It was a scream."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, I saw that one and loved it too. I remember watching the puppet TV shows decades ago - Thunderbirds, I lived for that one."
"__COMEDY__ Team America was such a perfect copy of the marionettes in Thunderbirds, and at the same time, a total sendup that was fearless in its comedy."
"__COMEDY__ I got a kick out of the goofiness of marionette movement and the lip moves and stuff - that was a constant funny throughout the whole thing."
"__COMEDY__ Yes, and the sendup of the despot Kim Jong Il in his underwater lair like some Bond villain, was just falling down funny."
"__COMEDY__ Totally. I remember him singing 'I'm Lonely ('Wone-wee' in that hilariously awful Engrish) as one of his dispatched political victims floated in the water outside the window."
"__COMEDY__ The tasteless stuff was the funniest stuff, honestly. Remember the puppet sex scene in the 'unrated' version?"
"__COMEDY__ Funny enough that a puppet movie could be forced to cut certain scenes for sexual content, just let that sink in for a moment. But they were so funny, I can't imagine watching the tamer version"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, if you're gonna go for it, jump in with both feet, right?"
"__COMEDY__ Thunderbirds must have been rolling in its grave, but Team America is a really funny movie."
