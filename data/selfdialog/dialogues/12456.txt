"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you like the Chargers move to Los Angeles?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hated that decision. The Chargers should be San Diego's football team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know it's sad that San Diego doesn't have an NFL team now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just a really bad move. Los Angeles already has the Rams."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't understand the move either. I mean win games, and the seats will get filled."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, it's not like the Chargers are like the Cleveland Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Philip Rivers is a future Hall of Fame quarterback he just always comes up short because of the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know how they'll be received in LA but I think Philip Rivers will have another good season for the Chargers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope they made some good signings in the offseason."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They made a few but I don't think it'll be enough to contend or compete with the Raiders or the Chiefs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That AFC West division is looking like a two team race at the moment."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't discount the Broncos. They still have a solid defense if not one of the best in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not forgetting the Bronco's defense but I just think they're offense is going to look terrible this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah there isn't anyway the Denver Broncos can take the AFC West."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They might be able to sneak into a Wild Card spot though don't you think?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure, because the Baltimore Ravens, the Cincinnati Bengals, and Pittsburgh Steelers always battle it out for the last Wild Card spots, whoever doesn't win the division."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be tough for sure but I think defense goes a long way and the Broncos at the least have that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that's why the Texans are going to be battling hard for that spot too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ JJ Watts is back so Houston should be a real threat in the AFC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It'll be interesting to see if the Patriots can keep it going with all the competition this season."
