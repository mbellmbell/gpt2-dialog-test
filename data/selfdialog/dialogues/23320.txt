"__DISNEY__ How was the new Beauty and the Beast movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I haven't seen the new Disney one yet, just the older animated Disney one."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, okay.  I heard good things about the new live action one."
"__DISNEY__ With Emma Watson?  The previews looked good."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, loved the sets. Emma Watson makes a good Belle."
"__DISNEY__ I think so too. Is the new version a musical?"
"__DISNEY__ I think so, like the animated one."
"__DISNEY__ Wonder if it has the same songs."
"__DISNEY__ Its hard to say.  Looks like they spent a lot of money on it."
"__DISNEY__ Very true.  I'm excited to see it."
