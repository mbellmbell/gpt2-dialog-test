"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's almost football time, man."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, sir. Pats are gonna take it all the way for Brady's sixth ring, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think that too. I wonder who can even beat them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe the Packers, but Rodgers has to start playing for real in the playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, until this year, he was one-and-done since 2011."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I didn't know that, but it doesn't surprise me. They always fall in the playoffs early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think he needs a better defense. His offense is obviously pretty decent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Pretty decent!? I think you mean aboslutely monster!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No Lacy this year though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. But they got Bennett."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He may add another dimension to their blocking game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They probably need him with getting their new back up to speed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's still an offense that revolves around Rodgers though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, yeah, for sure. His arm is probably the best in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Remember those Hail Marys!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah. I felt so bad for the Lions!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I felt so bad for the Packers when they had a successful Hail Mary against the Cardinals, but then lost still."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That was a downer. But that pitch to Fitzgerald was amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, it was. Well, I'll see you on the first kick off next month."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sounds good. Football is almost back!"
