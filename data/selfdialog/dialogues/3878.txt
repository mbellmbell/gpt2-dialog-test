"__MUSIC__ What have you been listening to lately?"
"__MUSIC__ A bunch of oldies, mostly."
"__MUSIC__ Really, like what?"
"__MUSIC__ All different stuff. For starters, a ton of Elliott Smith."
"__MUSIC__ Ah! I love him."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I never get tired of his albums."
"__MUSIC__ Me neither. I was doing chores around the house the other day, and I just listened to his album, Figure 8 on repeat."
"__MUSIC__ That one's great. Is that your favorite?"
"__MUSIC__ Eh, that's a tough call."
"__MUSIC__ I know. They're all good."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite though?"
"__MUSIC__ X/O. Hands down. It's incredible."
"__MUSIC__ I agree! So many people prefer either/or, but I like X/O the best."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think?"
"__MUSIC__ Ah, the production is just insane. What about you?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally! I also really dig how much you can hear the Beatles' influence."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I read this review one time, the reviewer called Elliott Smith derivative of the Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ No way! He was definitely inspired by them, but it's not like he was constantly ripping off their tunes."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It's ridiculous. They compared his song, 'Now you're just somebody that I used to know' to 'Ive just seen a face'."
"__MUSIC__ They're nothing alike. I'm so glad you agree though. Let's listen to XO in the car."
