"__MOVIES__ Have you seen the new Justice League Movie?"
"__MOVIES__ No. It doesn't come out until November."
"__MOVIES__ I meant the prequel to that movie. You know Batman Vs Super Man."
"__MOVIES__ Yep. I saw that one when it first hit the theaters."
"__MOVIES__ I just bought the dvd and watched it last night."
"__MOVIES__ What did you think?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know if I like Ben Affleck as Batman."
"__MOVIES__ I felt the same way. We've been spoiled by Christian Bale."
"__MOVIES__ He is the ultimate actor for playing Bat Man."
"__MOVIES__ I agree. Those Dark Knight movies were epic."
"__MOVIES__ They were the best Bat Man movies to date."
"__MOVIES__ I agree 100%."
"__MOVIES__ But this Bat Man vs Super Man movie, ugh I didn't like it too tough."
"__MOVIES__ Why not?"
"__MOVIES__ It didn't feel right. I couldn't get into it."
"__MOVIES__ You just want Christian Bale to return to his role as Bat Man."
"__MOVIES__ He was, is and forever will be the Dark Knight."
"__MOVIES__ But he was tired of loosing his voice playing the Bat Man."
"__MOVIES__ I understand. I just feel like taking that DVD back and getting my money back."
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't that bad."
