"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm worried about the future of the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The massive amounts of head and bodily injuries that mess with athletes will overwhelm people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Look at how bad these guys turn out. More and more research shows massive injuries that aren't reversible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But people love football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sort of - a lot of kids just like doing it to hurt each other. They can take out their aggression in other ways."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ At least the kids like it, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure they do. The parents hate it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, I see parents pulling their kids out of little league and high school football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Less people playing equals less in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Or, lowering their standards to allow more in. There will always be people wanting to play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ahh, the American dream. Get paid $10 million to play a game instead of a real job."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ha, that's trivializing it a bit, but point taken."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope we find a way to make it safe, or find an alternative."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Americans are just aggressive people."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I guess the NFL is safe, but I'm just worried that sentiment will change."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If anything, money will do it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If cities stop supporting teams, they'll have to close down. Faded interest does mean the teams leaving."
