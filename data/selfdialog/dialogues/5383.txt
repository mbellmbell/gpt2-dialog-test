"__STAR_WARS__ Do you have any favorite side antagonists in the Star Wars movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I think that I really like the sand people."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh man, they were scary."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes they were!"
"__STAR_WARS__ Especially their yelling."
"__STAR_WARS__ It creeps me out to hear them make that noise."
"__STAR_WARS__ Their outfits were so cool though."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes I really like the things on their heads."
"__STAR_WARS__ I am not even sure if that is there face or a mask."
"__STAR_WARS__ Me either! I wonder if there is something under it."
