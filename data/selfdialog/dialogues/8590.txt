"__BEATLES__ Do you think the Beatles are overrated?"
"__BEATLES__ No, I don't think so. Their songs are certainly popular, but I don't think that necessarily means overrated."
"__BEATLES__ Yea, I mean their songs are super catchy. And to have that type of sound during that era of music must have been really exciting."
"__BEATLES__ I feel like they were like the original boy band/popstars of their time."
"__BEATLES__ Oh for sure. Their music kind of set the tone for a new era of Rock n Roll."
"__BEATLES__ And their songs were really fun and had a lot of energy."
"__BEATLES__ Yea, I feel like they were really original and were presenting something that was unheard of before."
"__BEATLES__ Songs like 'Twist and Shout' and 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds' are my favorites."
"__BEATLES__ They're so catchy, but also a lot of their songs sounds really psychedelic which I feel like was kind of the iconic sound of the 60's."
"__BEATLES__ Yea, for sure. But even today you could listen to them and still be into it."
