"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Wow what a day. I need to take a break and listen to some music and unwind"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What kind of music helps you unwind?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I like ambient music the best."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Like what or who?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Oh let's see... i like Nicholas Gunn. He is from England."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ I haven't heard of him"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He is very new age and also EDM, and plays flute."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What do you mean a flute? Like a metal flute or a Zamfir like thing?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ He was trained in classical music from 7- 11 and then he moved with his family to California."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ well that is a broad scope from EDm to New Age"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ yeah I guess he had to find his 'voice'."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ What do you like of his that I should listen to?"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Hi album Afternoon in Sedona Is what made me like his music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Ok I will give it a try"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ If you don't listen to but one of his songs try Bamboo. It's a little less 'sweet and syrupy' as some of the other ones. It's got a beat to it."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Not really something that i would normally go for but hey who knows.."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ That particular one is more like what I would call World Music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ Yeah I know what you mean by world music."
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ OOo that reminds me of that video that is on youtube with people from all over the world played parts of the song Stand by Me from the indigenous countries. So cool!"
"__MUSIC_AND_MOVIES__ O good I need to look that one up too. Thanks!"
