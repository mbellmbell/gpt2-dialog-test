"__MOVIES__ Do you like western movies at all?"
"__MOVIES__ What, do you mean like movies made in the western world, in other words Hollywood?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean the western genre -- the kind of movie that usually has cowboys in it."
"__MOVIES__ I guess so. I don't think they've made any in a long time."
