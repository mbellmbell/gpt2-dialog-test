"__MOVIES__ Hey Alfredo, have you seen any movies lately?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh hi, Valentino, yeah I saw Baywatch the other day."
"__MOVIES__ Baywatch?  Was it any good?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, you know I like The Rock, so I might be biased, but yes I did!"
"__MOVIES__ Interesting were there any other familiar faces in it besides The Rock?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson made cameos."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, from the original series, that's cool."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they were actually pretty funny cameos."
"__MOVIES__ That's awesome, what was the plot...it did have a plot, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Ha ha, yes it had a plot.  It was about a hotel owner that smuggled drugs."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, how did that involve lifeguards."
"__MOVIES__ The hotel was on the beach, and the police didn't notice."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, so it was a crime drama comedy?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, pretty much.  It had quite a bit of humor in it."
"__MOVIES__ What was it rated?"
"__MOVIES__ It was R, mainly for language, but there was also some humorous male nudity in it."
"__MOVIES__ Humourous male nudity?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah.  I will have to explain it to you later."
"__MOVIES__ Would you recommend Baywatch?"
"__MOVIES__ I would, just make sure there aren't any kids around."
