"__SUPERHERO__ I'm hoping the superhero movie genre does not get stale."
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't think it will, look what they are doing with The Avengers. Making single movies about individuals superheros and then putting it all together."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, but how long can that last?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I don't know, but they is a lot of stories to tell"
"__SUPERHERO__ I see what you mean. I did really like Logan."
"__SUPERHERO__ Logan was amazing, it was sad to see the ending though."
"__SUPERHERO__ Hopefully, its not the end of that series"
"__SUPERHERO__ I'm sure X-Men will come back with other timelimes or something"
"__SUPERHERO__ I hope so, I enjoyed it from the beginning."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yea, especially wolverines storyline."
