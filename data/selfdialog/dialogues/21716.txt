"__DISNEY__ Have you ever head of the movie Bolt that Disney made?"
"__DISNEY__ That's the one about the dog who thinks it really has super powers but is just an actor for a show right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yup that movie."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I have and I have seen it too. It was alright."
"__DISNEY__ It seems to be one of the less known movies they did I think."
"__DISNEY__ True I never really heard much about it even when it first came out."
"__DISNEY__ Still I feel like it was a good movie and John Travolta did a good job for the voice."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah he was a good choice."
"__DISNEY__ I think what made the movie the best was the banter between Bolt, Rhino and Mittens."
"__DISNEY__ Yes, those guys antics were hilarious especially Rhinos."
