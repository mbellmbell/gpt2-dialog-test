"__MUSIC__ Man that thing was crazy."
"__MUSIC__ What you talking about?"
"__MUSIC__ I just downloaded You Can Spend The Night by Guy."
"__MUSIC__ That was that thing. Wasn't that on the New Jack City Soundtrack?"
"__MUSIC__ No. I think Fantasy was."
"__MUSIC__ I forgot all about Fantasy."
"__MUSIC__ Guy was the truth."
"__MUSIC__ No, the late eighties were the truth. All that good classic r and b."
"__MUSIC__ I know right. Heavy D, Teddy Riley, Aaron Hall, all that new jack swing."
"__MUSIC__ Teddy Riley was killing the game. Super producer indeed."
"__MUSIC__ I think he inspired Puffy to get into the music game."
"__MUSIC__ I know. Teddy and them were doing parties down at Howard Homecoming and Puffy was a buck, soaking it all up."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if those two ever hooked up to make a track together."
"__MUSIC__ I wouldn't be surprised. Teddy had his hands in everything back then."
"__MUSIC__ I think he produced some stuff for Janet Jackson too."
"__MUSIC__ Janet had everybody on her team. Teddy Riley, then Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis."
"__MUSIC__ I think she is supposed to be going on tour later this year."
"__MUSIC__ Janet better sit her behind down."
"__MUSIC__ You trippin'. If she come to Philly I'll be buying tickets."
"__MUSIC__ Get me one. I love Janet Jackson like a fat kid love cake."
