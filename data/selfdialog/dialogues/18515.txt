"__MOVIES__ Are you planning on seeing the new Wonder Woman movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I will definitely watch it at some point, not sure about opening weekend though."
"__MOVIES__ I know what you mean.  I don't like going to see movies on opening weekend.  It's just too crowded now."
"__MOVIES__ Agreed.  I like the crowds to die down a bit, and then I usually go see the movie.  A couple of weeks after it comes out."
"__MOVIES__ Well what do you think about the Wonder Woman movie in general?"
"__MOVIES__ I am pretty excited because it is getting very good reviews."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  People are saying it is the best of these recent DC universe movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well I have to watch it first to make that judgment."
"__MOVIES__ But to be honest with you, I have not thought the earlier DC movies were that bad!"
"__MOVIES__ Me neither.  I enjoyed the Superman movie, Batman versus Superman, Suicide Squad.  I thought there were all good movies."
"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about the actress playing Wonder Woman?"
"__MOVIES__ Gal Gadot, right?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, her.  I believe she was in some of the Fast and Furious movies."
"__MOVIES__ She was.  I think it's great casting.  She's beautiful and has a natural charisma that you need to play these superheroes."
"__MOVIES__ Well I hope she does a good job and that this movie is good.  Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic superheroes."
"__MOVIES__ I agree.  She was in the Batman versus Superman movie for a bit, and the character seemed great."
"__MOVIES__ You are right.  I am glad they did briefly introduce her and the character beforehand so we have a slight idea of what to expect."
"__MOVIES__ Well this is all setting up the Justice League movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, that should be quite exciting."
"__MOVIES__ Well all these movies are guaranteed to make a ton of money, at the very least."
