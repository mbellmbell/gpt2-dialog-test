"__MUSIC__ Did you ever listen to Iron Maiden?"
"__MUSIC__ Nah I never got around to it, but I've heard lots about them."
"__MUSIC__ Want me to tell you more about them?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, why not."
"__MUSIC__ They were pretty big in the 80's, my dad's a huge fan."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I know that much at least."
"__MUSIC__ They've got some really iconic songs and melodies though, which is cool for 80's metal."
"__MUSIC__ I don't think I have heard any of them."
"__MUSIC__ You should listen to The Trooper definitely, that one is on a few different albums I think."
"__MUSIC__ Any others I should listen to?"
"__MUSIC__ The whole Piece of Mind album is good."
"__MUSIC__ Don't they have a weird looking mascot?"
"__MUSIC__ They do, that's Eddie."
"__MUSIC__ He has a name?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah he's like a zombie character that's on all their album artwork."
"__MUSIC__ That's pretty cool."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. Oh, also 2 Minutes to Midnight is good."
"__MUSIC__ Was that on a Guitar Hero game?"
"__MUSIC__ Some of their songs were, it might have been."
"__MUSIC__ I'll write those down and look them up when I get a chance."
