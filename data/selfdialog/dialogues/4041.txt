"__MUSIC__ Been to any good concerts recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah man, we saw The Joy Formidable the other night. They were really good."
"__MUSIC__ Never heard of them, what are they like?"
"__MUSIC__ They're a three-piece band from Wales. They're pretty heavy, but very melodic. Female singer."
"__MUSIC__ Sort of like Paramore?"
"__MUSIC__ No, not really. More like a less grandiose version of Muse."
"__MUSIC__ I used to love Muse for their first few albums."
"__MUSIC__ Man, me too. I don't know if they changed too much or if I did, but I can barely listen to them anymore."
"__MUSIC__ Weird then that you're really into this other band that sounds like them."
"__MUSIC__ Ha, maybe, although I think The Joy Formidable takes the best parts of Muse and strips out the stuff that I came to not like about of them."
"__MUSIC__ I hear you. On a related note, I caught The Flaming Lips the other night at a festival here in town."
"__MUSIC__ No way, how were they? I hear they're crazy live."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was pretty bonkers. The music was OK - I am only really into a couple of their albums - but the show was great."
"__MUSIC__ I would love to see those guys."
"__MUSIC__ What would you say was the best concert you've seen recently?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh man... probably Mutoid Man in Atlanta."
"__MUSIC__ You saw Mutoid Man? How were they?"
"__MUSIC__ Dude, they're crazy good. Really goofy."
"__MUSIC__ I've watched some of their live clips on YouTube; they seem super fun."
"__MUSIC__ They were awesome. My brother went with me, and he caught one of the drummer's drum sticks. It was a pretty sweet night!"
