"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think about Tony Jefferson joining the Ravens?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well last season resulted in a Pro Bowl selection so I'm sure they think he's a good fit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well from a defensive standpoint I think the team suits him well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I personally think it's too soon to tell but I hope he's happy with the move."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You didn't see him on Total Access the other day?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I caught a bit of the interview but I missed the majority of it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh you should of see it. I thought it was a good interview."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did he say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well he talked about how well the team defense fits his personal style of play."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ One thing I've noticed from his play is he like to cover."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he was literally Arizona's swiss-army knife on defense. He did everything well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well I'm sure he's going to do well, i can't really see him failing unless the tam holds him back somehow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What kind of things do you think the team would do to hold him back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Anything that would force him to play out of his comfort zone is enough in my opinion."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't see the Ravens doing that to him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't either, It would be a dumb move overall on their part."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Absolutely agree with you there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he will carry his team to the super bowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's really hard to tell but I wont say it's impossible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wouldn't say it's impossible either."
