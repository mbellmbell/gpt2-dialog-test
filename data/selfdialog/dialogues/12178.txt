"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think much of today's NFL players. They don't really have the skills and passions of the older guys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I know what you mean. All my favorite players retired at least 20 years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are some of your favorites?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I have quite a few actually. To begin with, there's Fran Tarkenton."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Scramblin' Fran Tarkenton. I remember him; he was great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was one of the best ever, but somehow he always seemed to lose the big game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He just didn't have the players to support him, I think."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're probably right. Of course, there are other great players like Eric Dickerson."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember watching Dickerson in high school. My team played his Sealy team in the state playoffs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What happened? Dickerson ran all over my team, just like he did to every defense in the NFL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No kidding. Him and Larry Csonka and Rocky Bleier. Those guys just couldn't be stopped."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Don't forget Jim Brown. He was probably the most unstoppable of all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about defensive players? Did you have any old-time favorites?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I have plenty. Deacon Jones, Ed 'Too Tall' Jones, 'Mean' Joe Greene, and the rest of them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I forgot about 'Mean' Joe Greene and his Coke commercial. That was classic."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, all those old guys made some great commercials. Of course, Peyton Manning makes great commercials nowadays."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does, but Peyton Manning is the exception. His commercials are always fun, but nobody else does such good commercials."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess you're right about that. So how about kickers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kickers are easy. No one beats George Blanda and Morten Andersen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I suppose you're right about that. They were the best, probably of all time."
