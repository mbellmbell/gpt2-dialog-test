"__DISNEY__ Did you hear people are complaining about the new Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ Ugh. The outrage never stops."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's getting ridiculous."
"__DISNEY__ So what are they complaining about?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, the new Beauty and the Beast has a gay character."
"__DISNEY__ That doesn't seem objectionable to me."
"__DISNEY__ Nor to me."
"__DISNEY__ People can be the worst sometimes."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, and the ridiculous part about it is that Beauty and the Beast is about a woman falling in love with an anthropomorphic animal."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, there was no objection to that as far as I've seen."
