"__STAR_WARS__ So, with The Last Jedi coming out this Christmas, do you think Luke's gonna die?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No way, man, Luke's too important for the series."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't know, all the actors are getting pretty old now."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but Luke's the only one left now, since Han's dead and Leia's actress died."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess that's true, but they didn't know that and they might have already killed him off before that."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it'd be too repetitive to kill Luke off right after Han died. Besides, someone has to teach Rey!"
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, but they could always use force ghosts."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true. Do you think Obiwan will show up any?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I sure hope so, he's my favourite character from the prequels."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, he was in the originals too, but I get what you mean."
