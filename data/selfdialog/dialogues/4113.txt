"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Lana de Rey song, the one with the Weeknd?"
"__MUSIC__ I did, it's really pretty. Kinda sad though."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that kind of Lana's style though, pretty but sad?"
"__MUSIC__ It is, but her music is all dreamy and beautiful and it's easy to forget sometimes that they are kind of tragic."
"__MUSIC__ You know this one was inspired by an actress that jumped off the Hollywood sign."
"__MUSIC__ Wow! That's intense."
"__MUSIC__ It is. I think she really turned it around though, I mean Lust for Life has a hopefulness to it that makes it feel more inspiring than the story it's based on."
"__MUSIC__ That's true, I mean it literally says a lust for life keeps us alive."
"__MUSIC__ Also there's a ton of references in that song. The title itself is a nod to Iggy Pop's Lust for Life."
"__MUSIC__ Doesn't she say something at one point about My Boyfriend's Back?"
"__MUSIC__ She does! I hadn't even thought about that. There are those little 'doo wops' in there too that feel very vintage."
"__MUSIC__ The whole song is like a love letter to this rose-coloured version of Hollywood and music history."
"__MUSIC__ It is. But is that a bad thing?"
"__MUSIC__ No, because since it's Lana del Rey, it comes across as more subversive than if it were a more conventional pop star."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. She often explores dark things but with that dreamy pretty quality that makes them seem less scary."
"__MUSIC__ I like that the Weeknd is on this track, his voice really just melts into the song with her voice and it sounds great."
"__MUSIC__ I wasn't sure about him at first, I hadn't really liked Can't Feel My Face."
"__MUSIC__ You didn't? I loved that song, could never stop singing it!"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah well, I really like him in this song."
"__MUSIC__ Good, maybe you should listen to his solo stuff again, you might like it."
