"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Katy Perry's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's okay, but not really my thing."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I just like her old stuff more."
"__MUSIC__ This is different from her old stuff? I haven't listened to it yet."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it just seems darker somehow."
"__MUSIC__ Huh, I guess I'll give it a pass then."
"__MUSIC__ It's fine if you like more heavily-produced stuff, but it just wasn't for me."
"__MUSIC__ That's fair. Maybe I'll look up some of her singles on youtube."
"__MUSIC__ That's a good idea. Swish Swish is the latest one, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks, that helps."
"__MUSIC__ So what music have you been listening to recently?"
"__MUSIC__ I listened to Lorde's new album the other day."
"__MUSIC__ What did you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I thought it was good, but again not really like her old stuff."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's what I heard. I haven't listened to it yet."
"__MUSIC__ It was fine, though. A little more poppy than her old stuff, but her voice is the same."
"__MUSIC__ That's good to hear. I was on the fence about it."
"__MUSIC__ I would definitely listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ Thanks for the recommendation."
