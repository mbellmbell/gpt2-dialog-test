"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL team do you like to root for, despite not needing to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not needing to?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know, like not rooting for a regional team, or someone you grew up a fan of, or someone you know."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, like rooting for the Giants like you do, despite being from Chicago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You're silly. And, probably the Packers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Why them?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They have an insanely-long waiting list for season tickets, meaning every game is a sellout."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, that's true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But the best part is the city."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ How so?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Green Bay is tiny, especially compared to other football cities."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Isn't it the smallest?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yup, by far."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right, I forgot."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So they have the best fans, I think, due to population and attendance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Does it matter that they've been winning recently?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Nope, I always admired their fan base."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Big fan of Aaron Rogers?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You know it. Great guy."
