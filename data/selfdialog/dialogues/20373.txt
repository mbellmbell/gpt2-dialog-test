"__MOVIES__ Hey, have you seen the movie Minority Report?"
"__MOVIES__ With Tom Cruise!  Yeah, a long time ago."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it came out in 2002.  It's still a great movie, though."
"__MOVIES__ I remember seeing it in the theatres!  Yeah it was incredible."
"__MOVIES__ All of Steven Spielberg's movies are incredible though.  This is one of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, the way it depicted the future was pretty interesting too wasn't it?"
"__MOVIES__ It was definitely fascinating.  Colin Farrell was great in it too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he's a great actor.  I wonder what year the movie was taking place in?"
"__MOVIES__ It was 2054 so we aren't there yet."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I didn't know that.  Well, it's about 37 years away."
"__MOVIES__ It'll be interesting to see if we actually have any technology like that in the future."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I kinda doubt it.  The Pre-cogs were neat though weren't they."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah, they were fascinating.  What a mind to come up with a storyline like that."
"__MOVIES__ I know.  Tom Cruise was so good in the movie too."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah he was.  I thought a lot of parts were pretty sad."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, it made me sad about his family.  But it was redeeming at the end."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah it was.  It had a great ending."
"__MOVIES__ They should've made a sequel.  I could see a lot of potential there."
"__MOVIES__ Well you never know.  Maybe they still will."
"__MOVIES__ I guess it's possible."
