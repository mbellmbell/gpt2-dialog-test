"__MUSIC__ What are your thoughts on newer artists producing songs that pull of of older one?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ For example, the song Bad Things is clearly inspired by Out of My Head from the 80s."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, like that. You mean how Ghetto Superstar was basically Islands in the Stream."
"__MUSIC__ Right."
"__MUSIC__ I don't know. I guess I don't dislike it, but I hate when I can't figure out what the older song is."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. It drives me crazy."
"__MUSIC__ It seems to be a working formula though."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, it seems like all the songs that pull off of older ones end up doing really well."
"__MUSIC__ Why do you think that is?"
"__MUSIC__ I think people like the new twist on older classics."
"__MUSIC__ At least it isn't a complete remake."
"__MUSIC__ You don't like remakes?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know, I guess they are okay."
"__MUSIC__ Well some remakes end up bigger than the original?"
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ I Will Always Love You for example."
"__MUSIC__ Who remade it that's bigger than Whitney?"
"__MUSIC__ See you proved my point! Dolly Parton was actually the original singer."
