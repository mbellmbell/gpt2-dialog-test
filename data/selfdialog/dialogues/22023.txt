"__DISNEY__ My daughter's having a Disney princess party, and I'm trying to decide which movie we should watch."
"__DISNEY__ Does she have a favourite?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, she loves Frozen but honestly I might tear my hair out if I hear 'Let it Go' one more time!"
"__DISNEY__ True true! Well there are lots of other Disney movies, what about Beauty and the Beast?"
"__DISNEY__ The one with Belle? Oh, that one is so sweet!"
"__DISNEY__ And if you're tired of animation, you could even get them to watch the new live action one instead."
"__DISNEY__ Isn't that the one that Emma Watson starred in?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep! It came out a few months ago."
"__DISNEY__ I never got to see that one, that might be a good option."
"__DISNEY__ It's very similar to the animated one, I think you'll enjoy it."
