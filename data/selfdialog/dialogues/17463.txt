"__MOVIES__ Do you think they will ever remake To Catch a Thief? It has been a long time."
"__MOVIES__ That is an oldie isn't it? Who was in that one?"
"__MOVIES__ Cary Grant and Grace Kelly stared in it. It was from the golden age of movies but I would love to see a new spin on it."
"__MOVIES__ I cannot imagine who could fill those shoes. That is like recasting Casablanca."
"__MOVIES__ I admit it would be hard to do, but I miss movies like that. I also miss stars with charisma like that."
"__MOVIES__ Is that your favorite Cary Grant movie? I love Hitchcock's Notorious myself."
"__MOVIES__ Oh yes, that was with Ingrid Bergman wasn't it. That was a wonderful black and white movie."
"__MOVIES__ Yes and much more typical of Hitchcock. He was a brilliant director."
"__MOVIES__ I have not seen a few of his classics, The Birds and Psycho look too intense for me."
"__MOVIES__ You must have seen Vertigo and Rear Window. They were thrillers but not too intense."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I saw both of those. I loved Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window."
"__MOVIES__ He was amazing. You cannot beat It's A Wonderful Life if you are a Jimmy Stewart fan."
"__MOVIES__ That was one of my favorite movies of all time. What a priceless message."
"__MOVIES__ I have thought of that movie many times in my life. There is something for everyone in that movie."
"__MOVIES__ They have remade it several times, but nothing has ever touched the original. They didn't even come close."
"__MOVIES__ No they missed the mark. Maybe that is why they don't do other classics, it is just too hard to fill those shoes."
"__MOVIES__ I think the best thing to do if you love the old classics is to go out and buy them. I do not think you can replace directors and actors like those."
"__MOVIES__ It might be fun to see them do High Noon. I would love to see a modern version of a western classic."
"__MOVIES__ I love Gary Cooper movies. High Noon and Sabrina were my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Oh come on, you have to put Sargent York on that list. That was a great movie."
