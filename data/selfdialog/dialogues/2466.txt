"__MUSIC__ It's been a great year for music so far, don't you think?"
"__MUSIC__ I agree, so many of my favorite artists have released new songs!"
"__MUSIC__ Who are some of your favorites?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like Fleet Foxes a lot."
"__MUSIC__ Me too! They had a long hiatus so it's great to hear them with new material."
"__MUSIC__ 'Third of May' is as good as their best stuff on their earlier albums, in my opinion."
"__MUSIC__ It's a great song, and so is the follow-up teaser track, 'Fool's Errand'."
"__MUSIC__ They have a pretty flawless record since they came out, as far as I'm concerned."
"__MUSIC__ Another band that's coming back and I'm excited about is The National."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, their new song is a departure for them, in a good way."
"__MUSIC__ The vocals are a giveaway that it's The National, but I'm really digging the faster beat on the new track."
"__MUSIC__ Speaking of comebacks, and faster beats, what about LCD Soundsystem?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a huge fan of theirs, I saw them on Saturday Night Live a couple weeks ago."
"__MUSIC__ I missed it, but I've heard both new songs and based on that I'm sure I'll be buying the new album when it drops."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't seen them in concert but I'm hoping to get a chance when they come around here."
"__MUSIC__ I almost forgot, one of my absolute favorites lately, The War on Drugs."
"__MUSIC__ Their last album was so good! The new song, 'Thinking of a Place', is proof that it was no fluke."
"__MUSIC__ It's amazing that it's 11 minutes long and I still wanted more!"
"__MUSIC__ There are so many other acts showing up with new material too, like Grizzly Bear, Phoenix, and Haim."
"__MUSIC__ It's a great summer for indie, that's for sure!"
