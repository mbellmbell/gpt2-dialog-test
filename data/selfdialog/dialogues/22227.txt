"__DISNEY__ Have you seen the new Pirate movie?"
"__DISNEY__ No, I've only seen the original."
"__DISNEY__ Oh, you should see it! It was really great."
"__DISNEY__ I really like Johnny Depp."
"__DISNEY__ Me, too! He nails the character."
"__DISNEY__ Is it scary? My daughter doesnI't like scary movies."
"__DISNEY__ It's not that bad, but very sensitive kids might be bothered."
"__DISNEY__ I think we'll wait until it's on video."
"__DISNEY__ That's a good idea. Then you can always turn it off."
"__DISNEY__ I'll do that. I'm glad you liked it, though!"
