"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think the Eagles will be any good this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know- I think a lot of it will depend on how their QB does."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I thought Carson Wentz looked promising last season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so- the Eagles need some stability in their roster- especially at QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea its been a revolving door since NcNabb and maybe Vick. Its like every year there is a new guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But a QB still needs a good group of players around him- not sure if we have a strong offense"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sproles is getting old isn't he and Marshall is just good. What about wide-outs?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We used to be so good with DeShawn Jackson....remember?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yea but they got Torrey Smith from the Ravens didn't they? And Alshon Jeffrey?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Thats true- both are good- but I worry Torrey Smith is too old as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am excited to see what another year with Pederson will be like since he spent last year undoing a lot of problems"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True, I think Chip Kelly really screwed up the Eagles in so many ways- it may take another year to get it back to form."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe. I loved Andy Reid but it was time for him to go- too many post seasons ending too soon"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I liked him too, but I was ok with the decision for something new- but Chip Kelly was not a good fit."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Pederson could be good- but Laurie and Roseman needs to get him a good staff to work with"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True- the pre seaon is starting soon so we should see"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Still I am most excited about Carson Wentz- especially after a full season under his belt"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And a more veteran team to work with this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope he works out- it would be great to have a franchise quarterback to build a team around"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed- let the Carson Wentz era begin!"
