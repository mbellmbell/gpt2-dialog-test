"__MUSIC__ Do you think you will come see Ludacris this fall with me?"
"__MUSIC__ No I really don't think I will get the time off to see him."
"__MUSIC__ That stinks. I really hoped you would get to hear some of the songs you listened to back in the day."
"__MUSIC__ You are telling me! I love Ludacris!"
"__MUSIC__ I think that TI is going to be there with him too."
"__MUSIC__ You really think so? Maybe I'll skip work."
"__MUSIC__ I think you should. It is a once in a lifetime concert."
"__MUSIC__ I really love the CD Red Light District."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah I have had that CD playing in my car all week. It is so amazing!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think I could borrow it to get in the mood to go to the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely! I really love track 2, Number One Spot."
"__MUSIC__ That is my favorite too. It was all over the radio back in the day!"
"__MUSIC__ Do you think we could use your connection to get back stage at the concert?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh I think I could talk to him. He usually likes to trade free spots back there for some music!"
"__MUSIC__ What kind of music does he like?"
"__MUSIC__ He really loves alternative rock music!"
"__MUSIC__ That is kind of weird for a guy who is always at Rap concerts! I'll look and see what I have around the house."
"__MUSIC__ I will look too. I think I have a whole box full of CDs he would want."
"__MUSIC__ Great! I think this will be the greatest night of our lives."
"__MUSIC__ I can't wait to go to this concert with you! You really convinced me!"
