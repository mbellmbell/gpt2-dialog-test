"__ROCK__ Do you have a particular favorite rock band?"
"__ROCK__ I have been a huge Avenged Sevenfold fan these last number of years."
"__ROCK__ I hear that. They are a great band and I've been listening to them for a long time, as well."
"__ROCK__ Do you have a favorite album of theirs?"
"__ROCK__ I feel their self-title from around 2008 was very well done and had some great songs."
"__ROCK__ That was a good one. Nightmare, which I think was their next album, was also great."
"__ROCK__ Nightmare was an amazing album, too. I loved the song 'So Far Away.'"
"__ROCK__ Did you know that song was completely dedicated to The Rev?"
"__ROCK__ I have heard that, yes. Very sad he passed away so young."
"__ROCK__ Definitely but I think he would've wanted the boys in the band to continue on."
