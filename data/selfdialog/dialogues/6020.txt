"__STAR_WARS__ There are a lot of crappy deaths in Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally, some unimaginably awful."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's the one that bugs you the most?"
"__STAR_WARS__ EASY. Aayla Secura, my love, being distracted by a freakin' bird and then shot about 100 times in the back."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that seemed overkill."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yours?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Padm√©. Died of a broken heart. What a load of waffles."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's possible, you know."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, but it was lamely done. Plus, the robots are awful doctors."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, didn't they have anesthetics? Couldn't Obi-Wan use the force to calm her?"
