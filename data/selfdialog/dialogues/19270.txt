"__MOVIES__ I just can't get into raw footage horror movies."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously?! They're like some of my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ Oh god, really? Like Blair Witch Project?"
"__MOVIES__ Okay well Blair Witch wasn't great, but it was a good start."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, stop there."
"__MOVIES__ No! You should give them a shot. Have you heard of Ti West?"
"__MOVIES__ Mmm... rings a bell."
"__MOVIES__ He did this movie called The Sacrament. It's basically a fictionalized version of the Jonestown massacre."
"__MOVIES__ Isn't there a documentary out on that?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but trust me. This one's worth watching."
"__MOVIES__ I just hate the shaky camera work."
"__MOVIES__ I get that but when you watch it on a smaller screen it's fine."
"__MOVIES__ If you say so..."
"__MOVIES__ I do. But also, my favorite raw footage movies are ones where the people filming are supposed to be a documentary crew."
"__MOVIES__ Oh so it's not like phone cameras like Cloverfield?"
"__MOVIES__ Ugh, no. Cloverfield was nauseating."
"__MOVIES__ Blair Witch was pretty similar."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah but it was still better than Cloverfield. I promise you The Sacrament is better with the camera than either though."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, maybe I'll give it a shot."
"__MOVIES__ You should - it's great. The Last Exorcism is along the same lines, too, just FYI."
