"__MOVIES__ What ever happen to that Stallone movie Demolition Man?"
"__MOVIES__ What movie?"
"__MOVIES__ You know, the movie where Stallone got put into cryo-sleep for a crime he didn't commit."
"__MOVIES__ The one with Wesley Snipes?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, that's the one!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, I love that movie!"
"__MOVIES__ How cool was that old Buick 442?!!"
"__MOVIES__ That car was awesome.  Way cooler than the future cars."
"__MOVIES__ Don't forget the 'three sea shells'!!"
"__MOVIES__ Haha!  What's the three sea shells?"
"__MOVIES__ I always wished the movie told us what they were!!"
"__MOVIES__ I guess some things we will never know."
"__MOVIES__ It's too bad.  I wish they'd make a sequel and tell us."
"__MOVIES__ You think they would.  They remake everything these days."
"__MOVIES__ Just look at Bladerunner..."
"__MOVIES__ I hope they don't ruin it like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, don't get me started on that!!"
"__MOVIES__ You and me both.  Terrible!"
"__MOVIES__ Well, maybe they'll do a good job."
"__MOVIES__ I think they will.  The previews look good."
