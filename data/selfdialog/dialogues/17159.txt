"__MOVIES__ Did you see that they finally made a Tupac movie?"
"__MOVIES__ I know!  I'm so excited to see it!"
"__MOVIES__ Me too!  Did you notice when it came out?"
"__MOVIES__ On a Friday?  What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ It wasn't just any Friday - it was his birthday."
"__MOVIES__ No, I didn't notice that."
"__MOVIES__ Yep, June 16th."
"__MOVIES__ That guy they cast really looks like him a lot."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, they did a really good job with that."
"__MOVIES__ But I heard he wore a cap for the movie."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean, a cap? Like a baseball cap?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I mean like, to cover his hair."
"__MOVIES__ But Tupac was bald."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, exactly.  Instead of shaving his head for the movie, the actor wore one of those bald caps."
"__MOVIES__ Seriously?  That's odd.  I mean, did he have really great hair?"
"__MOVIES__ Hahaha, no.  I'm pretty sure he just has regular hair, nothing special."
"__MOVIES__ Wow, he looks good for the role, but that's a lack of commitment."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, you'd think it wouldn't be much for him to just shave his own head."
"__MOVIES__ True.  Well it isn't going to change anything for me- I'm still going to see the movie as soon as I have time."
"__MOVIES__ Me too- let me know when you're going maybe we can meet up for it."
