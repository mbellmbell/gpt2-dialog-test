"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So what do you like better, the old Snoop Dogg music or newer Snoop Dogg?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's a really tough call because all his music is great!  But I guess I'd have to say Doggystyle was his best."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I can play that entire album over and over again."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Oh, I do, all the time.  His newer stuff has slightly more complex beats."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It seems a little different, yes.  He branched out in another direction."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But it's still great.  I love everything he's ever done."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ He's definitely one of the best hip hop artists of all time."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Along with Tupac for sure."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, I wish they had done more music together."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, they would make a truly amazing duo."
