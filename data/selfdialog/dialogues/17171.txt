"__MOVIES__ Are you excited for all these new DC movies?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, in a way I am."
"__MOVIES__ Why would you not be?"
"__MOVIES__ I prefer the Marvel Universe movies."
"__MOVIES__ I like DC better."
"__MOVIES__ Why do you like those movies over Marvel?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they tend to be a bit more gritty than the Marvel movies."
"__MOVIES__ How do?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, Batman for one."
"__MOVIES__ Batman has to be dark, he is the Dark Knight."
"__MOVIES__ Well, even the Superman movies are a bit more dark than say, Xmen."
"__MOVIES__ Day of Future Past was actually really dark."
"__MOVIES__ You think more than Batman?"
"__MOVIES__ I think the whole Xmen franchise was dark and gritty."
"__MOVIES__ Come on, Xmen the Last Stand was a joke."
"__MOVIES__ That movie gets a bad rap"
"__MOVIES__ The way they just let Summers die, off screen bothered me."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that was part of the plot, to build into the new one."
"__MOVIES__ The newest one just erased all the old one."
"__MOVIES__ That was part of the plot!"
