"__BASEBALL__ So, what do you think about the Cubs this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ I am not a Chicago fan, so I haven't been following them too closely."
"__BASEBALL__ They haven't been doing that good."
"__BASEBALL__ That is surprising, considering they are coming off a World Series win."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, I thought they would be doing better."
"__BASEBALL__ What is their record?"
"__BASEBALL__ They are at 21 and 19 right now."
"__BASEBALL__ Wow, that is not bad...but not great."
"__BASEBALL__ I think the problem is really in their pitching."
"__BASEBALL__ How are they doing in that category?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, their overall team ERA is under 4.00, but a few of their key starters are struggling?"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah, that hurts if they can't get good starts out of these guys."
"__BASEBALL__ For example, Lackey is over 4.2 and Arrieta is over 5.00!"
"__BASEBALL__ Ouch, how is Lester doing this year?"
"__BASEBALL__ Much better, his ERA is under 4."
"__BASEBALL__ Good, but they need a team effort to be competitive this year."
"__BASEBALL__ I know, especially since the Brewers are on fire."
"__BASEBALL__ I did not expect that team to be doing so good."
"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs are going to have to step it up as summer approaches."
"__BASEBALL__ Maybe they can make some trades that would help them."
