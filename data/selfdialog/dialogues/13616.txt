"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think the NFL needs to change?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they really need to work on their television production."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need to get rid of the 1000 commercials in a game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It does make the games too long."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a commercial break after everything now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would you change from a rules perspective about the NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't really know.  The rules of the game aren't bad right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they should call roughing the passer less?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think you should be able to hit the quarterback without getting a penalty everytime."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seems like if you touch Tom Brady that's a penalty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree but if you kill someone like Jay Cutler isn't no penalty."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the NFL has protect their golden boy Brady."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I get protecting the quarterback but it really affects the game unfairly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish the rules were like in the 70s."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh you mean where you could basically kill someone?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was a mans game back then."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah but there were a lot more injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey it's football not ballet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think the NFL has done a pretty good job of adjusting the rules."
