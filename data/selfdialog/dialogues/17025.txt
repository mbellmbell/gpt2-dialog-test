"__MOVIES__ See anything good lately."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, man, you know what I just watched? Blade runner."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, cool. With Harris on Ford."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, me and Harrison Ford watched Blade Runner together."
"__MOVIES__ Cool! Which version did you see?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't know. The Blade Runner one."
"__MOVIES__ Duh, but there's like a million versions of Blade Runner."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I don't know."
"__MOVIES__ Did it have voice over at the beggining?"
"__MOVIES__ No, I dod not think that it did."
"__MOVIES__ Well, then it was the director's cut, or the ultimate cut."
"__MOVIES__ The director's cut isn;t the ultimate cut?"
"__MOVIES__ Brah, it's complicated."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well, it's like dope anyway, you know?"
"__MOVIES__ Daryl Hannah is great in it."
"__MOVIES__ She'd the best. And that part where the dud is like 'How long do I live?' and Harrison Ford is like 'Four Years!' And the guy's like 'Longer than you.'"
"__MOVIES__ I didn't get that part. Harrison Ford was older than four."
"__MOVIES__ Unless he was a replicant!"
"__MOVIES__ Oh, wow, you just blew my mind wide open, bro!"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, well, it's a really good movie."
