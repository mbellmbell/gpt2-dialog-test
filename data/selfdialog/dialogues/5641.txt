"__STAR_WARS__ So which did you like better the old Star Wars or new ones?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh the old ones by far."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, the prequels just didn't have the same feel."
"__STAR_WARS__ I can see how some people look at the special effects.  But the writing was awesome in the originals."
"__STAR_WARS__ However did you see Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, that had the feel of the original movies."
"__STAR_WARS__ Also crazy special effects."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know right?  The planet shots of the Death Star were un-real."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm hoping that the next movie has that feel to it too."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, on the new ones lets not let Jar Jar off the hook either."
