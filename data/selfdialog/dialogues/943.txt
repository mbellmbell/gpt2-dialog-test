"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is the greatest guitarist of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ I know a lot of people say Jimi Hendrix, but I'm gonna go with Jimmy Page."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah.  There's no doubt in my mind at all that Jimi is great, but Led Zeppelin overall was a better band than the Experience."
"__MUSIC__ So you think Page's guitar playing was better because the band he was in was better?"
"__MUSIC__ Well...yeah.  The songs were much better, and in the end, that's what it's all about."
"__MUSIC__ What other guitar players do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ Slash, Dave Gilmour, Stevie Ray Vaughn."
"__MUSIC__ All legendary.  I'm more a lead singer fan."
"__MUSIC__ Who are your favorite lead singers?"
"__MUSIC__ Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, David Lee Roth."
"__MUSIC__ You like Van Halen?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I love Van Halen.  You don't?"
"__MUSIC__ I think they're ok, but I never got into their music.  It all sounded like commercial jingles."
"__MUSIC__ Well, they did do that Clear Pepsi ad, so that's valid."
"__MUSIC__ Since we both really like Led Zeppelin, did you know that Great White did an album of all Led Zeppelin covers?"
"__MUSIC__ Great White?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, they did Once Bitten Twice Shy."
"__MUSIC__ Haha, was the album any good?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was really good, and I liked that they admired Zeppelin so much, that they put the album out.  Their cover of D'yer Mak'er is really good."
