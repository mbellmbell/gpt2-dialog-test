"__LADY_GAGA__ If you could see any musician in concert, who would it be?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ Hmm I'm not sure. Probably Lady Gaga."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Oh, that's a good choice! I love her."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, she's one of my favorites."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I feel like she'd be great in concert."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I hear her shows are amazing."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Do you like her newest album?"
"__LADY_GAGA__ You know not really, I'm not really a country fan. I like her older stuff."
"__LADY_GAGA__ I like Joanne, but I know a lot of people don't."
"__LADY_GAGA__ Yeah, I mean lyrically it's good, but I think it's the wrong genre. Most of her fans are into pop."
