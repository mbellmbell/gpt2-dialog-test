"__DISNEY__ You know in Snow White, does she just break into a random house."
"__DISNEY__ Yes."
"__DISNEY__ And then doesn't she just act like its her house and sleeps in the first bed she finds despite the fact there are clearly already occupants."
"__DISNEY__ Yes."
"__DISNEY__ That's so rude."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah but she was really tired and had a hard day running away from a homicidal witch."
"__DISNEY__ True."
"__DISNEY__ Something that did always bother me was how chilled the dwarves were to find a trespasser."
"__DISNEY__ Didn't they just make her their maid or something."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah that was really weird but it's not like she had anywhere else to go due to the aforementioned homicidal witch."
