"__BASKETBALL__ How crazy was that Celtics beatdown?"
"__BASKETBALL__ It was just nuts, truly, nuts"
"__BASKETBALL__ LeBron is amazing, and cruel"
"__BASKETBALL__ With Isiah out, the Celtics are done"
"__BASKETBALL__ Pretty much. They just don't have The Guy to stand up to superteams"
"__BASKETBALL__ This is what the Raptors and Hawks found out over the years"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think a well rounded team can win the title, just not against a Lebron team"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Pistons title team might have been able but I wouldn't favor them"
"__BASKETBALL__ The nice thing is that the Celtics have a ton of options to improve"
"__BASKETBALL__ Question is, would Gordon Hayward get them over the hump?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I just don't know, it comes down to fit. Al Horford hasn't been what they paid for"
"__BASKETBALL__ This is why I think Fultz is the best option"
"__BASKETBALL__ He is the one guy that looks like a superstar in the draft"
"__BASKETBALL__ Draft Fultz, and keep the status quo so he grows in a good environment"
"__BASKETBALL__ Agreed. Okay, so how do you see Warriors/Cavs 3?"
"__BASKETBALL__ The Cavs have to slow it down again, Lebron has to be amazing"
"__BASKETBALL__ Really, the Warriors have this as long as they are healthy"
"__BASKETBALL__ Which can always be a big if. Steph and Durant have had their share of injuries"
"__BASKETBALL__ I'm going with Warriors in 6. Cavs will have a crazy game from Kyrie that steals a game, and the Warriors will have one off game"
"__BASKETBALL__ Sounds about right to me. I'm pumped for the offseason, will another superteam emerge"
