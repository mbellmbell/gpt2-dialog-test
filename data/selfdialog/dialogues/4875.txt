"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Lorde Album?"
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't. Is it any good?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a really great followup to Pure Heroine."
"__MUSIC__ That album was really great!"
"__MUSIC__ I really loved the song Royals."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite song on the new album!  I will check it out when I get home today."
"__MUSIC__ You should just listen to the entire album, but If I had to choose, I would say 'Liability.'"
"__MUSIC__ Is it up beat or danceable?"
"__MUSIC__ No it's a slower song.  I think it's really sad, but the song is really emotional and beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ I prefer more upbeat songs.  Got a better suggestion?"
"__MUSIC__ The title track Melodrama is pretty danceable."
"__MUSIC__ Melodrama is the name of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but the first single that was released was called Green Light.  I think you would like that one."
"__MUSIC__ Can I dance to it?"
"__MUSIC__ Absolutely.  It will have you dancing all day and the chorus will get stuck in your head."
"__MUSIC__ So it's got a good chorus?"
"__MUSIC__ Green Light has a great chorus."
"__MUSIC__ Cool I need more Lorde in my life.  Maybe I will just buy the album now."
"__MUSIC__ I bought it yesterday. I own all of her music, even the songs she's released for soundtracks."
"__MUSIC__ Wow so you are a superfan!"
