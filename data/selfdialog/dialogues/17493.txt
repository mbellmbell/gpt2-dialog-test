"__MOVIES__ What is probably the worst movie you have ever seen?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh wow, that's a tough one."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, there are a lot of really awful movies out there."
"__MOVIES__ I think Santa Claus vs. The Martians was the worst one."
"__MOVIES__ What a terrible movie idea."
"__MOVIES__ Yes, it was really that bad."
"__MOVIES__ Were there any good parts at least?"
"__MOVIES__ Well, most of the movie was really boring."
"__MOVIES__ What was good though?"
"__MOVIES__ There was one particular part where somebody asked who was in an airlock."
"__MOVIES__ What happened then?"
"__MOVIES__ The guy goes, 'No one, now.' That was when he dumped the people outside into space."
"__MOVIES__ That's pretty terrible."
"__MOVIES__ I thought it was hilarious, it was such a badly delivered line."
"__MOVIES__ I think I would like to see this movie."
"__MOVIES__ It's very old so it might be hard to find."
"__MOVIES__ What year did it come out in?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure it came out during the 70's, it definitely looked that old."
"__MOVIES__ Ah, well that's not too bad. At least it's in color."
"__MOVIES__ That much is true, but don't expect a thrilling plot."
