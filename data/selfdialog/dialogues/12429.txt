"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only a couple months before football begins again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know and I'm really excited."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too, my favorite team just finally got a replacement running back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which is your favorite team?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a Seattle Seahawks fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So you're referring to replacing Marshawn Lynch?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, hopefully our new running back will provide what we need."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is the new running back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ We traded for Eddie Lacy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That might be a good fit, I've been a fan of his for some time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've been impressed with him in the past, but I'm concerned why Green Bay would trade him away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's definitely a valid concern.  Most teams wont trade high profile names unless there's some reason for them to do so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've seen lots of comments about his weight and it contributing to injuries."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think I remember hearing that he was overweight."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I saw a couple games where he clearly looked to be too heavy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully he'll be a hard worker for the Seahawks."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If he can stay in shape I think he will be the best addition to the team since Russel Wilson was drafted."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ And if he can keep from getting injured."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's always a concern, but I feel like he's more durable than the other guys we've had the past couple of seasons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like that Thomas Rawls guy is always hurt."
