"__MUSIC__ I like music from the romantic period."
"__MUSIC__ What's that?"
"__MUSIC__ Its the style that followed classical."
"__MUSIC__ It sounds like classical, doesn't it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. To the untrained ear, they sound very similar."
"__MUSIC__ What's the difference then?"
"__MUSIC__ Romantic period music used more extended chord structures, like major 7ths and 11's"
"__MUSIC__ I get you."
"__MUSIC__ One of the reasons people think the two periods are the same is Beethoven."
"__MUSIC__ I like Beethoven."
"__MUSIC__ His music bridged the two styles, even though it is considered classical by most."
"__MUSIC__ So Beethoven used complex chords?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but it was not thematic, it was only in passing."
"__MUSIC__ I've got some favorites that I don't know if they are classical or what."
"__MUSIC__ Tell me some composers or compositions and I will try to categorize them for you"
"__MUSIC__ Bach."
"__MUSIC__ Okay, he belonged to neither. His music was of the baroque style."
"__MUSIC__ That was before Beethoven, I believe."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. Liszt for example, was romantic."
"__MUSIC__ Like the Hungarian Rhapsodies which I love."
