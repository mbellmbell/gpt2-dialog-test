"__HORROR__ I finally saw Light's Out!"
"__HORROR__ By David F. Sandberg, starring Teresa Palmer?"
"__HORROR__ Yeah but I never heard of those people before. Palmer was so cool, though, as the lead."
"__HORROR__ Did you notice her Sandman poster on the door? Best Easter egg of the year."
"__HORROR__ No, I didn't, but it's cool to have an alternative type strong female lead in horror."
"__HORROR__ I agree, and her boyfriend was kind of the damsel in distress!"
"__HORROR__ Actually everyone was strong in their own way. I love when characters in a horror movie aren't useless."
"__HORROR__ Yeah, this movie did not feel like a slasher or an exploitation flick at all."
"__HORROR__ Is there another movie like that you would recommend?"
"__HORROR__ Well, have you seen Hush?"
