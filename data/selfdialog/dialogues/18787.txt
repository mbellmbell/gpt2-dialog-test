"__MOVIES__ Did you ever watch any of the Nightmare movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Nightmare on Elm Street?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, any of those."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, those are my favorite!"
"__MOVIES__ Do you like Friday the 13th?"
"__MOVIES__ Not really, but I love the Freddie movies!"
"__MOVIES__ What do you like so much about them?"
"__MOVIES__ Freddie is unique."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ I mean, it's not the typical slasher deal.  He kills them in improbable ways."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, yeah.  You can never guess what is going to happen."
"__MOVIES__ Right.  Jason Voohries is much more predictable."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, like that time Freddie sucked the life out of a girl in class when she fell asleep."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, something like that.  She had an asthma attack?"
"__MOVIES__ I don't remember.  I don't even remember which one that was."
"__MOVIES__ I think it was the second one."
"__MOVIES__ I've read that the guy that plays Freddie is a real nice guy."
"__MOVIES__ Well, it is acting."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the dude looks so sick!"
"__MOVIES__ I wouldn't want to be friends with him either."
