"__MOVIES__ I just watched the SpongeBob movie again."
"__MOVIES__ The first or second?"
"__MOVIES__ The first one. I didn't even give the 2nd a try."
"__MOVIES__ The first is the best. Why didn't you watch the other one?"
"__MOVIES__ Because that is not SpongeBob. SpongeBob is 2d, not that other kind of animation."
"__MOVIES__ I get it. The animation is fine with me."
"__MOVIES__ The animation is weird and since it's new, that means the humor is weird."
"__MOVIES__ What do you mean?"
"__MOVIES__ After the SpongeBob movie, the whole series went downhill."
"__MOVIES__ It's definitely not as funny anymore. Why is that?"
"__MOVIES__ Because the creator quit due to a dispute. He wanted the movie to be the end of the show, but Nickelodeon wanted to keep it."
"__MOVIES__ That makes sense. SpongeBob has got to be worth a billion."
"__MOVIES__ But when the creator left, the writes did. Now it's awful."
"__MOVIES__ Did you see any of the 2nd movie."
"__MOVIES__ I turned the trailer off after 20 seconds."
"__MOVIES__ You hated it that much?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I refuse to watch that."
"__MOVIES__ Well, the first one is great. I still think the 2nd is OK."
"__MOVIES__ The first one is perfect. Some of Patrick's best lines are in it."
"__MOVIES__ Patrick is amazing."
