"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to watch the NFL opening game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes I am I'm so excited"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about the hall of fame game?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is playing?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I believe it's the cowboys versus the cardinals"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Both of those teams have a good chance to win"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with you on that, it will certainly be interesting"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I really hope the cowboys win, they are one of my favorite teams"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they have a good shot"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will be interesting to see how it all ends up"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder if wall the starters are going to play"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Most likely not because it's before The season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah I think the coaches may be wise not to start their best players yet"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They want to avoid injuries"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, because afterall, the game doesn't really matter"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's just another way for the NFL to make money off the players"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep I totally agree."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well then it kind of seems immoral when you put it that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's why I actually think I will not be watching this year"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, we should both wait to watch until the regular season"
