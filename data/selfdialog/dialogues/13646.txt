"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Doesn't it seem like football just ended and the NFL is already almost back?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but I can't wait for training camp."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh same, just saying it went so quickly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, well, now it seems like the season is year-round with the draft and free agency."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It definitely has changed. Who do you like this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Cowboys to take another step forward this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, if Dak and Zeke stay healthy, it's possible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Only thing that concerns me is their aging o-line, but I still like them."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think they'll miss Romo's leadership?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not sure, honestly."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I did think it was best for him to retire."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, he shouldn't risk long-term injury."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Agreed, I look forward to seeing him as an announcer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, anyone will be better than Phil Simms."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh for sure. He was terrible at announcing games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yep, I think NBS is the best to watch games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Collinsworth is good. I love when my Giants are on NBC."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You like the Giants!?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, what's wrong with the Giants?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Eh, I just don't like Eli Manning."
