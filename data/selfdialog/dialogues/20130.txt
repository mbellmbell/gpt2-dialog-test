"__MOVIES__ In general are you a fan of the Star Wars series of movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Oh absolutely.  The first Star Wars has a special place in my heart because that was the only movie I remember going to with my father."
"__MOVIES__ Cool, how old were you when that move came out?"
"__MOVIES__ That first Star Wars came out in May of 1977, so I would have been 12 then.  Boy, we had never seen anything like that when that movie first came out."
"__MOVIES__ So as a young kid did you have a certain character that you liked best?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I was drawn to Han Solo and Chewie, they were such good buddies.  Plus Han was an incorrigible smart-ass, he really amused a 12 year old me."
"__MOVIES__ So through the years have you kept up with all the movies in the franchise?"
"__MOVIES__ Yes, I've seen them all.  It boggles the mind to think that I've been watching Star Wars movies for over 35 years now."
"__MOVIES__ Jesus, that makes me feel old when you say it that way.  So were there any low points along the way?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I would say that after all the waiting and the hype, the movies that made up the prequel were not my favorites."
"__MOVIES__ That seems to be a common sentiment among you Star Wars geeks."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but the more recent movies have really redeemed themselves and made me excited and interested in the franchise again."
"__MOVIES__ Really?  I haven't seen the most recent movies.  Is it the same cast or what?"
"__MOVIES__ Well it is largely a new cast of characters, inhabited by actors I was not familiar with before the movie.  But they were all very good in the movie I thought."
"__MOVIES__ Interesting.  Do you remember their names now?"
"__MOVIES__ The three main heroes were played by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac.  And the new bad guy was played by Adam Driver from that HBO show Girls."
"__MOVIES__ So you would recommend that I see this movie?"
"__MOVIES__ If you have in the past enjoyed any of the old Star Wars movies, then I would say absolutely.  You will be pleasantly surprised for sure."
"__MOVIES__ Do any of the old cast appear in the movie?"
"__MOVIES__ Well I don't want to give away of the fun, but I will say that you will get to run across some of your old favorites from the classics!"
