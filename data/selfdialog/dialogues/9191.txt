"__BASEBALL__ That was an impressive win by the Brewers against the Cubs."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the Brewers did a great job of taking over that game"
"__BASEBALL__ That was a tough game to play in with all of the rain"
"__BASEBALL__ I think Major League Baseball should have probably stopped the game a little sooner"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the conditions were getting a little crazy out there"
"__BASEBALL__ But to the Brewers' credit, they were resilient and found a way to get the win."
"__BASEBALL__ That's what good ball clubs do"
"__BASEBALL__ I couldn't agree more. I mean it was 46 degrees out there and 37 degrees with the wind chill factored in."
"__BASEBALL__ Sounds more like football weather instead of baseball weather"
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah the game was for almost 2 hours at the top of the 6th inning."
"__BASEBALL__ That is a long wait to try and complete a game."
"__BASEBALL__ It really is, but the Brewers are looking good. They have won 10 out of their last 12 games."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah they got a great game from Orlando Arcia."
"__BASEBALL__ I believe he had 3 hits and a RBI"
"__BASEBALL__ In contrast the Cubs pitchers were wild."
"__BASEBALL__ They walked 10 batters yesterday."
"__BASEBALL__ That's not going to win you a lot of games."
"__BASEBALL__ Even with that they were in a good position to win until reliever Mike Montgomery blew it."
"__BASEBALL__ Yeah he came in and immediately loaded the bases"
"__BASEBALL__ The Cubs have Arrieta going tomorrow, so maybe they can right the ship."
