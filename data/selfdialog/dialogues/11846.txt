"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So what is your prediction for the Super Bowl this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wish an unexpected team would take it but it will probably be someone like the Patriots again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team do you think would be the most surprising to go there?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There are a few, but probably the most surprising would be the Browns."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can only imagine Vegas going nuts if the Browns were the AFC champions this season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I cannot imagine anyone betting on them. I imagine the AFC champs will be the Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I want to like them, just because of Brady's athleticism, but I just don't care for the coaching staff or the egos on the team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, Belichick is the kind of coach that you either love or you hate. As for me, I have mad respect for what he has done."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is definitely a good coach, but there are just too many questionable things about his coaching style. I'd rather root for players than coaches anyway."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So even if you go that way, you kind of have to admit that Brady is definitely the best quarterback in the game right now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, there is no denying his talents, that's for sure. I always pick him for my fantasy team when I can."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I try to do the same, but too many people want him for their team. I like Carr and Roethlisberger too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know a lot about Carr, but I really like what I have read. He is the highest paid quarterback now!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I read about that, he got a 125 million dollar contract. I hear he is a really good guy, plus his stats are pretty amazing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think I would choose Big Ben over Carr, just because he has experience."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true, plus the Steelers have been maturing as a team the last couple of years. They are bound to give the Patriots a run for their money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It is funny how everything comes back to the Patriots. I guess that is what happens when you have the best team in the league."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, but they also have an old team too, at least it is getting that way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I am going to cheer for them, but I hope that the Giants pull out the big win this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am going with the Raiders myself. I think Carr is going to really prove himself this year."
