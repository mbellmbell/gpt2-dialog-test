"__STAR_WARS__ What did you think of the latest movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I thought it was pretty good. Definitely better than the previous three."
"__STAR_WARS__ Can we at least agree that the one's with Mark Hammel were the best?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No doubt. The original three will always be my favorite trilogy."
"__STAR_WARS__ What's your favorite scene from Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The light saber fight between Darth Vadar and Obi One is classic."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's the whole good versus evil thing going on."
"__STAR_WARS__ Not only that but it was so new for it's time. The special effects at that time were breakthrough."
"__STAR_WARS__ To me Star Wars just takes you to another place."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree. I've never found another movie that just lets me completely get lost in it for a few hours."
