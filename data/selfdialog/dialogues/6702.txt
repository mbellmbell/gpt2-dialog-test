"__STAR_WARS__ One of the great things about Star Wars is that they manage so many fantastical aliens."
"__STAR_WARS__ I know! Like Jaba the Hutt."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm really surprised that the special effects were good enough to create him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Or yoda, for that matter."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah! I mean, at least Chewbacca was a tall guy in a suit."
"__STAR_WARS__ It's different when you can just put on a suit."
"__STAR_WARS__ Were there any others that you found particularly impressive?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I always thought Bib Fortuna was cool looking."
"__STAR_WARS__ Who was that again?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The alien who advises Jabba the Hutt!"
