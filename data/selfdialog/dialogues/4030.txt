"__MUSIC__ When someone asks you what kind of music do you like what is your usual response? Do you say one or two catgories?"
"__MUSIC__ Well I guess it depends on who I am talking to at the moment.Also who I have been listening to lately will obviously influence me."
"__MUSIC__ Okay I can see how that would be. So I am going to ask you right now what is your favorite."
"__MUSIC__ I suppose World Music. But then I love Pharrell."
"__MUSIC__ Pharrell caught my ear back when he did 'Frontin'' that boy has got some smooth moves and voice of liquid gold."
"__MUSIC__ He is so cute and seems like such a sweet guy. I definitely like his style."
"__MUSIC__ He has only gotten more awesome with age. His songs, his spirituality, and his view on life."
"__MUSIC__ He is one of my favorite judges on The Voice. He is so kind and helpful to the people that come on there."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if he has ever done World Music? I so could see him doing that."
"__MUSIC__ Yes that would be awesome to see where he could take something like that"
"__MUSIC__ 'Happy' is a song I will never get tired of no matter how many times I hear it. I loved it the first time I heard it in 2003 I think."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah and the 24 hr video he put out was brilliant marketing ploy. It was so much fun to watch!"
"__MUSIC__ Yes I loved how he did that in all different locations and all the people he used in his video. They all looked like they were happy."
"__MUSIC__ There aren't too many videos that make you feel good or give you a good vibe in your soul."
"__MUSIC__ I agree with you on that."
"__MUSIC__ Michael Jackson obviously tops that list with several of his videos."
"__MUSIC__ Christopher Walken dancing to Fat Boy Slim. Yeah makes me laugh every time."
"__MUSIC__ That man is so weird....in a good way!"
"__MUSIC__ There are lot of people who don't know he is a dancer."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't listened to  and watch the music video in a while. I think  should go do that right now!"
