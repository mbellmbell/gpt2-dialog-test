"__MUSIC__ Who do you think is the greatest singer of all time?"
"__MUSIC__ Wow that is tough. What kind of music?"
"__MUSIC__ Any and all kinds of music. Just the best singer."
"__MUSIC__ I have to go with Whitney Houston."
"__MUSIC__ She did have an unbelievable voice."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, she did. I would say either her or Celine Dion."
"__MUSIC__ Oh Celine is an excellent choice too. I love both of their music."
"__MUSIC__ You know. I would also have to include Christina Aguilera."
"__MUSIC__ She is very good at singing too."
"__MUSIC__ Those three all are just complete power houses."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree. They have amazing voices."
"__MUSIC__ I feel like Christina Aguilera will never be an iconic classic singer like Whitney or Celine just because she sings pop music."
"__MUSIC__ Agree. People will always see her in that way."
"__MUSIC__ It is a shame though because her vocals are amazing and her ballads are on par with the others."
"__MUSIC__ I do love listening to a good ballad that is sung really really well."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. Jennifer Hudson is a very good power house vocalist too."
"__MUSIC__ She is very good. She is the one from American Idol right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah she is!"
"__MUSIC__ Did she win?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, she lost American Idol but she still was so good she became so famous."
