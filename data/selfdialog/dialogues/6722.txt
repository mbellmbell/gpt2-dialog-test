"__STAR_WARS__ This is going to sound weird but I kind of felt bad for Darth Vader."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't get how he was bullied around so much when he had so much power."
"__STAR_WARS__ That always bothered me too.  Seemed like he could have destroyed anyone that crossed him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess I felt bad for Vader until we met the Aniken version of him."
"__STAR_WARS__ Aniken was super annoying, and he had so much crazy rage in him."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it was Hayden Christianson playing him though, I didn't like his acting."
"__STAR_WARS__ I also thought he was a little bit stiff, but I think that is how he was supposed to be."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ewan McGregor wasn't stiff though and he was a jedi."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved him in those movies!  He was my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ Liam was pretty good as Qui-Gon Gin too."
