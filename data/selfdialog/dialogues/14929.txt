"__ACTION__ How many Jason Bourne movies have they made?"
"__ACTION__ Four I think."
"__ACTION__ The whole franchise has kind of run together at this point."

"__ACTION__ The age doesn't bother me, but I just don't think there's much more of a story to tell."
"__ACTION__ The last movie was a bit of a drag."
"__ACTION__ Yeah, felt like a 'been there, done that' type of thing."
"__ACTION__ At least you get to see a lot of worldly locations in the films."
