"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite movie?"
"__DISNEY__ I really like the Lion King! I watched it all the time as a kid, and I just saw it on Broadway last month!"
"__DISNEY__ That was the movie with the baby lion that was friends with the warthog and the meercat, right?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! They adopted the baby lion, Simba, after his uncle killed his dad."
"__DISNEY__ Heavy stuff for a kid's movie!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, but there were some great songs. I liked 'Hakuna matata!'"
"__DISNEY__ That is a good one! It means no worries, for the rest of your days."
"__DISNEY__ Yes! And it made 'The Circle of Life' such a classic song. Once you hear it, it's stuck in your head forever!"
"__DISNEY__ Is that the song that plays at the beginning of the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah! When the sun is rising over Mufasa's kingdom."
