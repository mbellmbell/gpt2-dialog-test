"__MUSIC__ Kendrick Lamar is the most influential poet of our times."
"__MUSIC__ Poet? You mean rapper?"
"__MUSIC__ Rap is poetry my friend."
"__MUSIC__ True that."
"__MUSIC__ Have you listened to his album, to pimp a butterfly."
"__MUSIC__ No I haven't I heard it wasn't that good."
"__MUSIC__ There are a lot of haters, but you have to just sit down and try to appreciate it."
"__MUSIC__ What is it about?"
"__MUSIC__ Well to pimp a butterfly is kind of a metaphor for African American beauty being sold, or pimped out."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah it really is interest. Kendrick really takes a dark, long stare at his own race."
"__MUSIC__ Is it negative to Black people?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really. It just keeps things real."
"__MUSIC__ So why is he the greatest poet."
"__MUSIC__ Well in this album, and his others. He calls out the problem, and he asks his people to fix the problem."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think people will actually fix their problems?"
"__MUSIC__ Maybe. One can hope right?"
"__MUSIC__ I hope so. African Americans are in a pretty bad place in America right now."
"__MUSIC__ That's true. The news is crazy."
"__MUSIC__ You can say that again."
