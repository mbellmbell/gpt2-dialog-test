"__DISNEY__ Did you know they released Cars 3 recently?"
"__DISNEY__ Wow, I can't believe they made another Cars movie!"
"__DISNEY__ I agree. Too many sequels can be annoying."
"__DISNEY__ It can never compare the to original either."
"__DISNEY__ The first one was so great on its own, so I couldn't agree more."
"__DISNEY__ I wonder what they wrote this one about?"
"__DISNEY__ Supposedly Lightning McQueen loses to a new racer and he has to fight his way back to the top."
"__DISNEY__ It just seems like a repeat of past movies."
"__DISNEY__ It does. I'm sure it's okay, but they should leave it alone after this."
"__DISNEY__ I probably won't end up seeing it."
