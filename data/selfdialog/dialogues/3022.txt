"__MUSIC__ So do you like Bruno Mars?"
"__MUSIC__ That depends on what you mean by that."
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, I like a lot of his old songs, but I really don't like any of his new pieces."
"__MUSIC__ Really? You don't like 24K?"
"__MUSIC__ Honestly I find that one super annoying."
"__MUSIC__ But the beat is so good!"
"__MUSIC__ I guess, I just think the lyrics are obnoxious."
"__MUSIC__ Well, what about That's What I Like?"
"__MUSIC__ I like it better than 24K, but I still think it's kind of obnoxious."
"__MUSIC__ Do you not like confidence or something?"
"__MUSIC__ I do, but there's confidence and there's arrogance, you know?"
"__MUSIC__ I guess. What of his old music do you like?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm a big fan of When I was Your Man."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, you like slower songs."
"__MUSIC__ That, and also I think it's just a better piece of music."
"__MUSIC__ It does have a good melody, I suppose."
"__MUSIC__ Oh! And of course, I like Just the Way You Are."
"__MUSIC__ Well, at least we agree on something I guess!"
"__MUSIC__ Haha, sorry, I guess he's just not my favourite."
