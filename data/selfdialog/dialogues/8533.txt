"__BEATLES__ We were riding in the car with some young people and Come Together by Aerosmith came on the radio.  I like that, but I really prefer the original by the Beatles."
"__BEATLES__ The Beatles?  Isn't that the band Paul McCartney was in before Wings?"
"__BEATLES__ Um, yeah.  If it hadn't been for the Beatles no one would have ever heard of Paul McCartney. He and John Lennon wrote most of their songs, too."
"__BEATLES__ John Lennon - didn't he get shot?"
"__BEATLES__ Yeah, an obsessed fan shot him in front of his apartment building. That was a dark day."
"__BEATLES__ So after the Beatles, did John Lennon do anything?"
"__BEATLES__ He did some albums with his wife, Yoko Ono. Probably the biggest hit was Beautiful Boy, written for his son."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah.  I think I remember his son coming out and doing an album, too."
"__BEATLES__ No, that was Julien Lennon.  He was John's son by his first wife and John wasn't really part of his life. Beautiful Boy was written for Sean, who was Yoko Ono's son with John."
"__BEATLES__ Oh, okay. I guess I didn't know that much about the Beatles."
