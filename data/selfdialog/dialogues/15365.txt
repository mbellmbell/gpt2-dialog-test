"__HARRY_POTTER__ Seems weird, the whole concept of Horcruxes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, it's definitely different."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think Voldemort was kind of dumb though."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ How so?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Why hide your soul in well-known objects?  Do it in a tin can or something."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ If I remember right, it was because he wanted to prove a point."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ What point is that?"

"__HARRY_POTTER__ Well, if it were me, I would have done it in rocks or something."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ That's why you're not a wizard."
