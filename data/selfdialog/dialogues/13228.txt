"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If the team can get a solid start from BG it could really help set the table for a quick learning curve by Davenport, who in his own right is a pretty smart cookie."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a firm believer that Mancz earned the starting OC job based on last years production."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was the most consistent producer on the OL during the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's learned the calls and most of all, he had to help carry poor play at both G spots for the majority of the season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Su'a-Filo finally came on towards the end of last season, giving me a lot of hope that the light finally went on for him and 2017 could be his arrival season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ RG never gave Mancz a break...he helped cover the weak RG and the TE's had to help cover the weak RT. For this reason, I would roll the dice with Martin learning the RG job from the very start of the off-season program."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ BG, like Brown brings the veteran savvy to the comers which could finally help solidify this OL."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There will be plenty of bodies competing for backup spots and this could finally be on track to a decent and confidence building season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the idea of Martin being protected by Mancz and Giacomini during his rookie season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would like to see Foreman become the feature back and Miller be the backup...or change of pace guy"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Miller played a little heavier last season to compensate for the amount of carries he would be responsible for and he didn't do too bad."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ but he had his limitations."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'd like to see Miller drop 15 lbs. and be a scary good 2nd or 3rd down back where his ability to get outside and catch the ball would have to be accounted for by opposing defense's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Foreman would finally bring a dynamic to. The red--zone that this team has."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sorely missed since the AF days."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Ervin holds onto the RB4 spot. If the OL is better, this group could really help the QB's."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ TE's could get better if thei job was to play a traditional position and not have to be the extra blocker covering for a weak right side."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like this receiving group and feel like the team needs to find a way to utilize. Wendell. Williams. He is my sleeper on this offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's mediocre to me because he hasn't done anything."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dude hasn't thrown a TD yet. How in the world is that good."
