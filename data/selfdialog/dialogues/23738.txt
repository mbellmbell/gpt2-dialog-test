"__DISNEY__ Have you ever seen The Parent Trap?"
"__DISNEY__ The original one or the Lindsay Lohan one?"
"__DISNEY__ The Lindsay Lohan one. There was another one?"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it was made in the 60s."
"__DISNEY__ I'd never heard of it before now."
"__DISNEY__ I liked the newer version too, but it was a bit after my time."
"__DISNEY__ I loved the Lindsay Lohan version as a child. Thought she had real potential as an actress."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, it's a shame her career never went anywhere. She plateaued as a child."
"__DISNEY__ It's still a great kid's movie to this day."
"__DISNEY__ I agree, but most kids today want to watch what's new instead of what's good."
