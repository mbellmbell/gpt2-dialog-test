"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think Dak Prescott can get Dallas to a championship this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so. It has been a long time since we have been there."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He looked really good last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I think he was just too inexperienced to get as far as we wanted him too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too, and the fans leaned too hard into wanting Romo back."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't think Romo is as good of a quarterback as Prescott is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was when he was younger, but he gets injured too frequently now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He really has had some serious injuries. He probably should have stopped playing a few years ago."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ If their defense can do better this year I think they have a real shot with Prescott in as lead now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah the defense has been pretty bad the last few years."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They also need some more action from their receivers. I think Beasley should get more play time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They don't use him much because he isn't a big guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does really well when he is in though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Except for the fact that he tends to turn over the ball during key moments."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That hasn't happened often though and he has definitely scored more points than he has lost."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is an important part of the team. I don't think the give him the credit he deserves a lot of the time."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has had some key plays that have won games but they always focus on the star wide receivers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They definitely can't afford to lose him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true and they might want to give him a better contract so they don't lose him to another team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It would be a shame if they lost him to another team because they don't appreciate his talent."
