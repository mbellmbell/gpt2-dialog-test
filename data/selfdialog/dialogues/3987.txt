"__MUSIC__ My friend played me this crazy tuba piece today!"
"__MUSIC__ They're all crazy. That or just transcriptions of vocal music."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, original tuba music didn't come out until the 1950s or so."
"__MUSIC__ Interesting."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it wasn't respected as a solo instrument. So what was the piece?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't know what it's called, but he could sing and play at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ Cool! Multiphonics!"
"__MUSIC__ Can you do it?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, but not very well. You learn to vibrate your vocal chords and lips at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ This was like a beatboxing tuba."
"__MUSIC__ Fnugg?"
"__MUSIC__ That sounds right, I think."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, Fnugg is what you're thinking of. The tuba player is from Scandanavia."
"__MUSIC__ Is he famous?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure if he's famous for being a tubist, or for being a multiphonics-beatboxing tuba."
"__MUSIC__ He should be on America's got talent."
"__MUSIC__ I'll let him know!"
"__MUSIC__ You know him?"
"__MUSIC__ Of course not, silly. Good thought, though."
