"__DISNEY__ Do you remember the scene in Lilo and Stitch, where Lilo made a sour jar?"
"__DISNEY__ The one where she stuffed all three of her friends in the pickle jar?"
"__DISNEY__ That's the one. Did you notice the title on the book beside her?"
"__DISNEY__ I think it was Voodoo for Beginners."
"__DISNEY__ What's hilarious is that her friends all have these nice little dolls, and hers is a Voodoo Doll!"
"__DISNEY__ I liked it when she said 'My friends need to be punished', and in the jar they went."
"__DISNEY__ Lilo and Nonnie are all sorts of messed up, yet they have such a typical sister bond."
"__DISNEY__ I really like how that one was done."
"__DISNEY__ Me too. It shows that not all kids have a perfect childhood."
"__DISNEY__ Also shows the coping skills they can acquire. I think this is the only Disney movie that shows how the parents die."
