"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am in the mood for some good old fashioned football!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You will not have to wait much longer at this point."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems like it has been forever since the NFL has been on television!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Not really, every off season just feels that way for us true fans."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Speaking of the NFL, who do you think the best coach in the game is right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The question should be, who is the second best coach in the game right now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you mean by that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well the best coach is obviously Bill Belichick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is what everyone says, but I see it differently."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? He has built a powerhouse in New England!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, but I think that might have a little something to do with Tom Brady!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brady is great, but he has never won anything without Belichick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Belichick has never won anything without Brady either!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think we will just have to agree to disagree about this issue."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you want me to tell you who is really the best coach in the NFL at the moment?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would be delighted to hear your opinion on the matter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The answer is Pete Carroll. He is the best."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is certainly a great coach, I can not argue that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has been great in college and in the pros's. Not even Belichick can say that!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Talk to me when Carroll wins a few more Superbowl's!"
