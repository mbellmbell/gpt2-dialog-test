"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hi, NFL season is starting soon. I can't wait for the weekends during football season!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, me too. I've already got my recliner and remote ready to sit back and watch the games."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which NFL team is your favorite this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm a true blue Dallas Cowboy fan, always have been and always will be."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cowboys? No way man. I follow the Steelers every year!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Steelers were a big disappointment to their fans last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They need a quarterback man...but this year I have the feeling it's going to be their year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would have thought you'd be a Redskins fan since you hate the Cowboys."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Washington Redskins are all hype...preseason, they are great, then once the season starts, they fall apart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, their players are either on or off. No consistency there at all."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you going to any of the games in person?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I plan to attend a couple Cowboy games when they play away, which puts them closer to us."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's cool man. I would love to see Pittsburgh play but I'm definitely not going up there in that cold!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they may have a game in North Carolina with the Panthers, you could probably stand that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Good idea! I will have to check online and see the at home schedule for the Panthers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, if you find some reasonable tickets, I'd love to go if that's okay with you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ For sure! Nothing more fun that going to a NFL game with your friends!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just let me know what the price of tickets are and I will pay for my seat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, road trip!!  Going to North Carolina to see the Panthers play!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess we will have to root for the Panthers as our home team!!"
