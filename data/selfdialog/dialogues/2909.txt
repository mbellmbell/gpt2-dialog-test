"__MUSIC__ Okay, now it's your turn... what are some covers YOU like?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, let's see... I liked Twist and Shout by The Beatles."
"__MUSIC__ What, that was a cover?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the original was done by the Isley Brothers like a few decades before... can't remember exactly."
"__MUSIC__ Oh wow... I remember hearing that song I think for the first time in Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
"__MUSIC__ HAHA!  Yeah, I remember that scene.  Not the first time I heard it, but it's definitely a memorable moment of the film."
"__MUSIC__ Come, give me some more."
"__MUSIC__ Well... 'Cum On Feel the Noise' by Quiet Riot"
"__MUSIC__ Wait.. no way, that was a cover too?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was originally done by a different group."
"__MUSIC__ You're blowing me away with all these neat facts."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, the original is a lot more mellow though, has this older style, more seventiesish."
"__MUSIC__ Seventiesish?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, yeah, I know, that's note a word, but still, I think you understand what I mean."
"__MUSIC__ Come to think of it, wasn't Quiet Riot like one of these first hair metal bands of the 80s?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, them and Twisted Sister.  You could really argue those two pretty much started the whole 'hair metal' band trend."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's crazy so many people today like to deny they ever listened to that music growing up"
"__MUSIC__ Well, you know, to paraphrase Heart Shaped Box 'More people didn't like the music than did.  That's kind of the point.'"
"__MUSIC__ HAHA."
"__MUSIC__ Plus there's always a bit of backlash against whatever's popular.  I think that's true of any age."
