"__COMEDY__ Whats your favorite comedy about school?"
"__COMEDY__ Probably the movie called Accepted."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, that's a great one. Isn't that one of Jonah Hills earliest movies?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, it is. He was really fat back then."
"__COMEDY__ Haha, but still funny though. My favorite school movie is School of Rock."
"__COMEDY__ That's the one with Jack Black right?"
"__COMEDY__ Yeah where he pretends to be a substitute teacher and makes a rock band out of his class."
"__COMEDY__ That movie is great, I haven't seen it in a while though."
"__COMEDY__ That's a shame you should watch it again sometime."
"__COMEDY__ I probably will, now that you mentioned it."
