"__MOVIES__ What are your thoughts on Robert Downey, Jr. as Holmes?"
"__MOVIES__ I really like the movies. I like Jude Law is a great Watson."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, he really elevates Watson."
"__MOVIES__ And I think the second one with Moriarty is BRILLIANT."
"__MOVIES__ I feel a qualification coming."
"__MOVIES__ I don't think RDJ was a great Sherlock."
"__MOVIES__ But, it is that just because Cumberbatch is the goat."
"__MOVIES__ No, no Jeremy Brent is the goat. He played Holmes as written and still made it interesting."
"__MOVIES__ True. But I liked RDJ as Holmes before I saw Cumberbatch."
"__MOVIES__ I go Brent, then Cumberbatch. I think the movies just go on too long."
"__MOVIES__ I think the writting in the TV show is much better."
"__MOVIES__ I do too, except for the way they write Mycroft."
"__MOVIES__ Well, that's because Mycroft is a writer on the show and wants to have a bigger part."
"__MOVIES__ I really like the Mycroft in the RDJ movies."
"__MOVIES__ I liked Mary in those movies.  I wasn't a fan of Mary as an assisan in the show."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I agree."
"__MOVIES__ I like Mary being relevant but NOT a hired assasian."
"__MOVIES__ I also like the Moriarty in the movies."
"__MOVIES__ Well, I like the one in the series too."
"__MOVIES__ But the movie one is more traditional version with the math professor thing."
