"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What do you think are the Browns going to turn it around this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man they are such a mess.  All those number picks and really not much too show."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's hard to comprehend since the NFL has a salary cap that they can't put a better product on the field."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It really goes to show what a good front office in the NFL can achieve, or not."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just look at teams like the Steelers and Patriots."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They seem to always be good and don't always have the best players."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is your favorite player?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like Drew Brees from the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is an amazing athleter and seems like a good guy."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. He is really under-sized too, but he plays with a lot of heart."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I've heard that he is pretty short."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is, but his arm is incredible."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Saints really like to pass a lot and are fun to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Them and the Packers can really get after it on offense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes Aaron Rodgers is a great QB."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has some nice players on offense to pass too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like that he has good mobility too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He doesn't run as much as he did when he was younger, but he still has some juice left in the tank to out run defensive linemen."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He was a great replacement for Favre."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so too and they let him learn from him before just inserting him into the lineup."
