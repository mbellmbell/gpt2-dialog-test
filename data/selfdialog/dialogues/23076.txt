"__DISNEY__ I finally saw the new version of Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ I don't really think so, I have such a fond memory of the original one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, that one rocks.  Did you like anything better in the new one?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, they certainly developed characters more: Gaston and Lefou were better.  Gaston was almost sympathetic!"
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, I agree.  And you have to love the real scenes and fantastic CGI."
"__DISNEY__ That was breathtaking, you're right.  And it was nice seeing some big stars."
"__DISNEY__ Who knew Emma Watson could sing?"
"__DISNEY__ And so well.  I don't think every Disney classic has to go live action, but this one was ok."
"__DISNEY__ You just grew up with the animated one, a new generation will grow up on this one."
