"__MUSIC__ What do you think of Portugal the Man's new album?"
"__MUSIC__ The one with Feel It Still?"
"__MUSIC__ That's the one."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I guess. I'm not sure"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ The song is catchy, but also very pop. I'm torn"
"__MUSIC__ Is that a bad thing?"
"__MUSIC__ Not really, it's just not Portugal the Man's usual style"
"__MUSIC__ That's true, especially compared to in the Mountain Clouds."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly and the Satanic Satanist. But in the Mountain Clouds only dropped like two years ago."
"__MUSIC__ I see what you're saying. So you don't like it?"
"__MUSIC__ I do. Like I said I'm torn."
"__MUSIC__ They always switch up their styles though, between every album"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly, and that's generally the mark of a good artist."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! Don't be such an old man."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I have to give the whole album a listen through."
"__MUSIC__ Well it just came out. I think it's on Spotify"
"__MUSIC__ Really? I'll have to give it a listen"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, let me know what you think. They come to town next month"
"__MUSIC__ Oh let's go to that concert for sure"
