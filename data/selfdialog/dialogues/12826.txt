"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ This NFL offseason has been interesting."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah there have been some surprises and a lot of teams seemed poised to make it a competitive year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ There is one move that has me confused. Joe Montana comparing Colin Kepernick's situation to Tim Tebow."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did he say?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He said that it was his subpar completion percentage that did him in."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's not fair Tebow had a forty something percent completion rate and Kapernick was mid to high fifties."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Right. So Tebow we understand. You can't make it long in the NFL with those numbers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Kapernick's completion percentage is better than some starting quarter backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. So why is he not signed?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ OK. So the owners are saying it's the fans. They don't want him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He has apologized to the league and stated that he will stand for the National Anthem going forward and he still isn't signed."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you think he's been blacklisted?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It seems that way. That and his performance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So he isn't winning enough to make his not so distant past go away."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so. I've heard he also will only sign if he is going to start."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The only team that would be desperate enough to pick him up is the Jets."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They haven't even spoken to him and they are about to make the Cleveland Browns look good this season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe this is it for him in the NFL. I heard the Cubs drafted him out of highschool."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So maybe he is just like Tebow and he can go play baseball."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ America's favorite past time may not appreciate him."
