"__HORROR__ What do you think of them redoing IT?"
"__HORROR__ I am excited for it.. have you seen the trailer?"
"__HORROR__ I have and I do think they did a good job creating a creepy vibe."
"__HORROR__ I think it will be even better than the original It. It was a tv mini series and this is a movie which makes me think it will be better right away."
"__HORROR__ Maybe had not taken that into consideration. Probably won't have time to focus as much on the backstory of the characters."
"__HORROR__ True,I hope they don't loose the essence of the story itself. But think it looks amazing."
"__HORROR__ The new pennywise is super scary, I love tim curry but the updated version is even scary."
"__HORROR__ Bill Skarsg√•rd is set as pennywise in the new version. i don't know him to well, but think he will give a worthy show."
"__HORROR__ He seems so young, but then you see him in the make up and trailer and he is so menacing."
"__HORROR__ He really is. I am looking forward to his performance. As well as the kid from stranger things performance."
