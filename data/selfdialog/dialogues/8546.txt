"__BEATLES__ Do you like The Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ Not really, I'm more of a Rolling Stones fan"
"__BEATLES__ They're great, but I think The Beatles have them beat, no pun intended."
"__BEATLES__ Oh yeah? What are your favorite songs?"
"__BEATLES__ There's so many, but if you like the Stones then you should check out Day Tripper and Run For Your Life"
"__BEATLES__ Are they like All You Need is Love? I've heard that one, and I like it but it's not my favorite"
"__BEATLES__ Those songs are very different, as are a lot of their songs. They even have some heavier stuff like Helter Skelter and Back in the USSR"
"__BEATLES__ I haven't heard of those before. I wonder why they don't get any more attention?"
"__BEATLES__ I don't know, but the deeper you go into their catalogue, the more gems you'll find. It's like a bottomless well of amazing music, especially albums like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road"
"__BEATLES__ Alright, thanks for telling me! I'll give them a listen as soon as I can."
