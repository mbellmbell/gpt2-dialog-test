"__STAR_WARS__ I just watched Star Wars Episode I for the first time."
"__STAR_WARS__ For the first time?  Did you like it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ The special effects are a bit outdated, but overall it was a good story."
"__STAR_WARS__ I liked the story as well, especially learning about the Force."
"__STAR_WARS__ I found the Chewbacca character to be most interesting.  It's not often you see talking animals outside of cartoons."
"__STAR_WARS__ To be fair, he's an alien more than he's an animal."
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess you're right.  I just think it's interesting that he speaks his own unique language that only one person can understand."
"__STAR_WARS__ That is kind of funny.  It's the same way with the droids."
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Some characters seem to be able to understand the beeping sounds they make as communication."
