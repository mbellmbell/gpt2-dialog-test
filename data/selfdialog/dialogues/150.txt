"__MUSIC__ Have you heard of Phantogram?"
"__MUSIC__ No, who are they?"
"__MUSIC__ They're this duo from New York that have a eclectic pop sound."
"__MUSIC__ Sounds cool, maybe I have heard a song of theirs and not realized it."
"__MUSIC__ Probably. They are getting pretty mainstream."
"__MUSIC__ What's their latest album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's called Three, and it is their third album."
"__MUSIC__ Cool. I'll have to check it out. What do they sound like?"
"__MUSIC__ They sound like Little Dragon a bit, or even Sylvan Esso."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah?! I really like them."
"__MUSIC__ I'm surprised you haven't heard of Phantogram."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, me too. How is the newest album?"
"__MUSIC__ It's good, but it feels like they are trying to reach a wider audience."
"__MUSIC__ Does it sound over produced?"
"__MUSIC__ No, the lead female singer is sounding much better, but they lost some of their eclectic sound."
"__MUSIC__ In what way?"
"__MUSIC__ It just sounds like everything else that's out there now."
"__MUSIC__ That's not necessarily Phantogram's fault."
"__MUSIC__ True, but the earlier albums are so much more unique in sound than the new stuff."
"__MUSIC__ I know what you mean. I hate it when bands lose their core sound, or sell out."
