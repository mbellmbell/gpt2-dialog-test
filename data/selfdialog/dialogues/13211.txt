"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Any new rule changes for the NFL in 2017?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A fair few, yeah. For starters, regular season overtime is now only 10 minutes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Really? Any reason for that one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They cite player safety and the fact that only 26% or so of games the last few seasons had overtimes that went longer than that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that makes sense. But I do wonder if we'll see more tie games now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would imagine so, even if they are still relatively rare."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ A bit cheeky to cite player safety as a reason for a rule change but not consider dropping Thursday Night Football."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, but I bet those Thursday night games get them more money."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ No doubt. Any other rule changes?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, the best one! They are loosening up on penalties for on field celebrations!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Whoa. Does that mean touchdown dances are back?!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope so! There's still some restrictions - can't delay the game, mimic use of a weapon or be 'too sexy' - but it's a good sign!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That is awesome. Maybe they will be able to lose the No Fun League moniker!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Group celebrations, using the ball as a prop and going to the ground to celebrate are the things that won't be penalized any more, specifically."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am so glad. The touchdown dances were always a fun thing to watch."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Players got very creative with them. Think of how sad a place the world would be without the Ickey Shuffle."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I had completely forgotten about the Ickey Shuffle. I am not sure if I am thankful for the reminder or not, haha!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What would you consider the greatest touchdown celebration, if not the Ickey Shuffle?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Easy! The Lambeau Leap, of course."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Lambeau Leap isn't a dance, though, it's just a jump into the fans. Ickey Shuffle forever!"
