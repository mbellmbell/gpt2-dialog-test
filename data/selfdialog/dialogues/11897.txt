"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Sir, I am a huge Vikings fan."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Vikings? Of Minnesota?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The very same."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, it's great to meet another Vikings fan here in Florida."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Did you come down to retire too?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes sir, it's nice and warm here even in the dead of winter."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I would go back to see that playoff game, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, I would too, in a heartbeat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I just with Walsh could have made that kick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh me too, I couldn't believe he shanked it to the left."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It was very cold that day."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He still should have made the kick."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Do you know he plays for Seattle now?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh, is that right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's competing for a spot on their roster now."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That isn't surprising. He practically gave the game away last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Seattle's kicker went rouge too."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He still hit a few in that Vikings game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, that is true."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Let's hope Blair Walsh plays for the Seahawks next year and cost them a playoff game."
