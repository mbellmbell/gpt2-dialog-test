"__DISNEY__ What is the best Disney movie you have ever seen?"
"__DISNEY__ Flubber, with Robin Williams, hands down."
"__DISNEY__ That's funny. I didn't really think of that as a popular Disney movie."
"__DISNEY__ No? It's one of the best ones ever made because it inspired me to become a scientist!"
"__DISNEY__ Really? Flubber made you want to be a scientist?"
"__DISNEY__ Yep. Even when I was a kid I tried to replicate making that bouncy green goo."
"__DISNEY__ I'd bet your parents got mad at you for all the messes you made."
"__DISNEY__ Haha, yep. They sure did."
"__DISNEY__ Did you ever succeed in making something that could bounce balls high into the air like in the movie?"
"__DISNEY__ Nope. Unfortunately my parents took away my materials!"
