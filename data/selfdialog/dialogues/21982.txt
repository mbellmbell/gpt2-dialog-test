"__DISNEY__ Did you see the remake of Pete's Dragon?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I did. Did you like it?"
"__DISNEY__ Well it was different than the original. I can tell you that originally I wasn't happy they remade it."
"__DISNEY__ I never saw the original so I had nothing to compare it to."
"__DISNEY__ It was actually in many ways different and that was a good thing because I felt like I didn't have to compare the two."
"__DISNEY__ I really liked how they showed that there were lots of dragons actually living in harmony somewhere."
"__DISNEY__ Sure, but I thought that the relationship with Pete and the family that found him was great. They really developed that storyline"
"__DISNEY__ I am glad they didn't make it a musical."
"__DISNEY__ I thought that the CGI was really great. The dragon looked so real."
"__DISNEY__ The CGI was fantastic. It was like the dragon was really there interacting with the people. He was not cartoon looking either."
