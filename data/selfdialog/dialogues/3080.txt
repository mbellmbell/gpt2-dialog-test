"__MUSIC__ Have you decided to go to Riot Fest this year? The lineup is ridiculously good this year."
"__MUSIC__ I know, I know. Having Nine Inch Nails and Queens of the Stone Age on the same lineup is insane. I'm not sure if I can afford the $190 3 day pass though."
"__MUSIC__ You only live once. I bet you would regret not going if you didn't end up going."
"__MUSIC__ You're right. I probably will end up going. The rest of the lineup is very good too, I mean...Dinosaur Jr., TV On The Radio, Ministry, Paramore...the list goes on."
"__MUSIC__ I am very excited to see Paramore's set this year. I never really cared for them until their After Laughter album just came out."
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, is it good? I've been hearing good things about it."
"__MUSIC__ It's actually really great, I'm shocked at how good it is. It has a very 80's nostalgia-themed vibe to it."
"__MUSIC__ That's a very stark contrast to their previous sound, with the alternative-goth-esque sound they had."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it's really refreshing. David Byrne would probably think it's derivative of Talking Heads, but I don't care. It's great."
"__MUSIC__ I love it when artists take a risk like that and totally go in a new direction. If they're talented enough, it almost always pays off."
"__MUSIC__ Like when Kanye put out Yeezus? That album came out of nowhere and was brilliant from the first second."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, exactly like that. The textures on that album are so raw and dark, it wasn't exactly radio friendly either."
"__MUSIC__ And that's what I loved about it. David Bowie did the same thing, but throughout his entire career."
"__MUSIC__ You know, I am still very upset that he died. The man was an icon to millions, myself included. I literally went home and cried the day he died after work."
"__MUSIC__ He went out in such a Bowie-esque way, too. Putting out one of his best albums, and then dying two days later. Only Bowie could have done that."
"__MUSIC__ I have a hard time listening to that album, Blackstar, actually. It's such a great meditation on mortality and it's a really beautiful record. But it's very sad too."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, especially the last track, 'I Can't Give Everything Away.' It's one of his best songs."
"__MUSIC__ I'm still bummed I never got to see him live. His concerts were the stuff of legends."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I would have given anything to have seen him on the Outside Tour that he did with Nine Inch Nails."
"__MUSIC__ Whoa, they went on tour together! I had no idea. I need to find some performances on Youtube..."
