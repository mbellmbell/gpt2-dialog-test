"__MOVIES__ How do you feel about all the premium movie channels creating TV shows?"
"__MOVIES__ I do not think thats what they should do."
"__MOVIES__ But most people dont watch as many movies nowadays they have to do something"
"__MOVIES__ Thats not the real reason they create original content."
"__MOVIES__ Why do they do it then?"
"__MOVIES__ I think they need a reason to get subscribers."
"__MOVIES__ So the movies they play are not enough to keep people paying?"
"__MOVIES__ I think that people do not sit down to watch movies like that anymore."
"__MOVIES__ My own experience, I do not do so."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah see thats what I mean, the model has changed."
"__MOVIES__ I think HBO and Showtime still do a good job"
"__MOVIES__ I havent watched a movie on either platform in forever."
"__MOVIES__ You may be a single case though."
"__MOVIES__ The numbers do echo my sentiments as well."
"__MOVIES__ Thats strange because the subscriber rates are through the roof with both."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah because of the original shows they are producing."
"__MOVIES__ They do have more wiggle room."
"__MOVIES__ And no commercials."
"__MOVIES__ I am surprised they havent sold commercials yet."
"__MOVIES__ Why? They pay a premium just to get viewers"
