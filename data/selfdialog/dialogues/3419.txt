"__MUSIC__ Do you want to go to a concert with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, who are you going to see?"
"__MUSIC__ I was thinking of going to see Nine Inch Nails."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't they like Marilyn Manson? Scary metal stuff?"
"__MUSIC__ No, they're industrial and they have a lot of songs that play on the radio."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really. What ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Came Back Haunted, Hand That Feeds, Hurt."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't Hurt a cover of Johnny Cash?"
"__MUSIC__ Actually, no. Trent Reznor wrote it and it's on the 1994 album, The Downward Spiral."
"__MUSIC__ So Johnny Cash covered Nine Inch Nails?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, shortly before he passed away too. It was appropriate."
"__MUSIC__ That's sad. I really like that song."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, you'd like a lot of more Nine Inch Nails too. Trent Reznor does soundtracks for movies too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh really? What ones?"
"__MUSIC__ Gone Girl, for one. It sounds very Nine Inch Nails ish."
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea."
"__MUSIC__ Yep. So would you go to the concert with me?"
"__MUSIC__ Sure, when is it?"
"__MUSIC__ September 10th, at the arena. Prepare to be amazed."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, I am. It sounds like fun!"
