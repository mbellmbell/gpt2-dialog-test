"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hey, man, are you ready for some NFL?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can hardly wait. When does training camp begin?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I'm not sure but soon. It's July, you know. Preseason'll start soon."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who do you think's going to win the NFC South this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I like the Falcons again. What about you?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't decide, man. I want the Falcons to win, of course, but New Orleans is supposed to be much better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I heard that too. Drew Brees is tough."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He is, man. And he just seems to find a way to win if you give him the chance."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, I think last year was just an off year for the Saints."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hope this year is too then. And I'm worried about Carolina."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What did they finish last year? Man, Super Bowl one year and wash outs the next."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Cam Newton is just so strong. He's like a pro playing with eighth graders sometimes."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. That arm is like a rocket. But he doesn't scramble like he used to."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess even Cam is taking some knocks that slow him down."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's what they're complaining about, man. That the refs won't throw the flag on roughing."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess it isn't really fair. But Carolina definitely depends on him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's true. If Cam has a good year, Carolina will be tough to beat."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Like Brees and the Saints. When he's on and got a good team around him, I don't like to play him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I hear you. But we'll see. What about Tampa Bay? They got anything?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Man, I haven't kept up with them at all but I think they drafted a pretty good QB maybe."
