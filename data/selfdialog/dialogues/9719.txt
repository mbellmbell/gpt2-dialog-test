"__COMEDY__ If you had to only watch one comedy movie for the rest of your life, what would it be?"
"__COMEDY__ Umm...probably Zoolander."
"__COMEDY__ Haha! Excellent choice!"
"__COMEDY__ Yea, Zoolander is such a classic. I honestly don't think I've seen a more original and outrageous comedy."
"__COMEDY__ Yea, like the whole concept of the movie is so incredibly stupid but so brilliantly smart at the same time."
"__COMEDY__ I love it how Will Ferrell was in that movie before he was super famous. It's funny to re watch it and see him play Mugatu."
"__COMEDY__ Yea, he was hilarious!"
"__COMEDY__ Did you see the second Zoolander movie?"
"__COMEDY__ Yea...not a fan. It was basically just a sad attempt to copy the first."
"__COMEDY__ Yea, it felt like it was a parody of the first movie."
