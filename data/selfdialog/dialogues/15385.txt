"__HARRY_POTTER__ What is the best spell in Harry Potter?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Hmmm, Accio....the summoning charm. You could get stuff without having to get off your bed!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Accio, milk and cookies! Yeah that would be cool. How about stupefy? Stunning spells would be awesome."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, like when you hear annoying people complaining. I could use that. How about petrificus totalus! Now you're statue."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Sweet! I could use that one. What about the bat boogey hex?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I got someone in mind for that one!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah, me too. I could have used that the other day. How about ascendio? You could fly over a stadium or concert and watch from there!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah that would be cool. I could get in to that!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Confundo! Confuse and disorient to get out of jobs. That would be excellent."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah too bad my wand is in the shop."
