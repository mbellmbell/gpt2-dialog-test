"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Are you an NFL fan?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I am. I would say I almost study the game."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That's great to hear. I'm the exact same way."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It's a great sport. I look forward to the season starting every year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too. Who do you think the best running backs will be in the coming season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, you have to look at the guys who made the top 100 players. Ezekiel Elliot is probably number one."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can agree with that. I don't think their rankings are exactly accurate, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. It does depend a lot on the amount of support the player gets from his team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely. A running back isn't going to get anywhere without good openings."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, and that's something that has to be dealt with on the offensive line."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ True. I feel like offensive linemen are overlooked."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree. They play a very important role."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Just because they're not fast doesn't mean their role isn't as big as, say, a wide receiver."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Exactly. What other running backs do you think will be good this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Le'Veon Bell is going to do well for the Steelers."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's definitely up there in terms of running backs."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I also think David Johnson is going to be very impressive this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is that the running back on the Cardinals?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, you don't hear much about them. He's really good, though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He does have some impressive stats."
