"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite Radiohead album?"
"__MUSIC__ Ok Computer is my favorite, hands down. I like what albums followed it, but to me, electro Radiohead is not the best Radiohead."
"__MUSIC__ I used to think that too, but I just got A Moon Shaped Pool and I have to say, I'm blown away by it."
"__MUSIC__ I heard some of the singles off the album, and I was really unimpressed. I expected more from them."
"__MUSIC__ In my opinion, the 2 singles they released for the album were the weakest of all the tracks."
"__MUSIC__ How was the rest of the album?"
"__MUSIC__ Beautiful! It is a very sad and haunting album."
"__MUSIC__ Maybe I should give it another shot."
"__MUSIC__ I think you should, I can see myself listening to this album a lot over the years."
"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite track?"
"__MUSIC__ I actually thought Glass Eyes was one the more emotional songs, the lyrics are heartbreaking."
"__MUSIC__ I'll definitely give it another chance. Hearing you talk about makes me interested again."
"__MUSIC__ Funny how that happens."
"__MUSIC__ I always like to hear another person's perspective on music."
"__MUSIC__ Me too. I don't think any two people experience music the same way."
"__MUSIC__ Exactly. What one person thinks is terrible, another person thinks magical."
"__MUSIC__ If you want, I'll burn you a copy of  A Moon Shaped Pool."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, I'd really like that. Thank you."
"__MUSIC__ Its no trouble at all."
"__MUSIC__ Well, thank you again anyway!"
