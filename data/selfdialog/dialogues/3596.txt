"__MUSIC__ I can't believe that people still make fun of the Monkees."
"__MUSIC__ I know.  It's amazing. Their music is not only great, but it totally holds up."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and it's as strange as any music of the time."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree.  Even if they didn't write it all or even play it all doesn't matter."
"__MUSIC__ I totally agree.  The Beach Boys used studio musicians."
"__MUSIC__ I know, even The Byrds did, and they were known for their playing."
"__MUSIC__ So true -- in fact, they all used pretty much the SAME studio musicians."
"__MUSIC__ And what about Headquarters?"
"__MUSIC__ Totally! They wrote all of it, and it was fabulous!"
"__MUSIC__ I agree. They were equally as strange and good, musically, as anyone else of the time."
"__MUSIC__ I think Elvis got a bad shake in the 60s, too."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, yeah, a lot of his movies, even, were really good. He could just sing like no tomorrow."
"__MUSIC__ I think so, too.  I still watch Blue Hawaii every Christmas."
"__MUSIC__ I love Blue Hawaii!  Elvis is like Bing. It's like singing is what I do, it's so easy."
"__MUSIC__ That's just what it's like! Like it's so easy, it's nothing at all!"
"__MUSIC__ I think they had to beat Elvis to make sure the Beatles got full market share in '64."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I agree.  Really, there was room for both of them, so there was no need."
"__MUSIC__ You don't have to convince me."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite Elvis song?"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not sure. Maybe Little Sister. Or Marie!"
