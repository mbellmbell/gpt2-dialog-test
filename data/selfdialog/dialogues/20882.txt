"__THRILLER__ You know what was a classic movie?  Jurassic Park."
"__THRILLER__ I agree, it totally changed the summer blockbuster."
"__THRILLER__ Yes, the raptors were pretty cool."
"__THRILLER__ The special effects were all together.  Plus a pretty solid plot line."
"__THRILLER__ I agree, I was a young pre-teen boy at the time.  So I remember the triple Jurassic burger from MacDonald's or Burger King."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah I do too.  That was before they had triples all the time."
"__THRILLER__ You know what else was cool in that movie?  In the beginning when they were digging up those bones."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, it was like the calm before the storm."
"__THRILLER__ A good funny part of the movie though.  When that girl was going nuts over the extinct plant."
"__THRILLER__ Yeah, and she didn't see the dinosaur behind her."
