"__MUSIC__ I need your help with an 80''s playlist."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, what's it for?"
"__MUSIC__ We are having an 80''s themed party and I want to have plenty of songs to last all day. I have a good start but could use some more."
"__MUSIC__ OK, anything off limits?"
"__MUSIC__ Nope, I like everything from rock to love sones. Probably not too much country though."
"__MUSIC__ Ok, we'll you definitely have to have Rick Astley, Never Gonna Give You Up"
"__MUSIC__ Haha Rick rolling everyone. Great idea."
"__MUSIC__ You should play it every few songs just for fun."
"__MUSIC__ I think I might do that."
"__MUSIC__ How about the Cars? They have a bunch of great hits."
"__MUSIC__ Yes, good thinking. I hadn't added them yet."
"__MUSIC__ How about Rosanna from Toto?"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah! Did you know he wrote that for Rosanna Arquette after they broke up?"
"__MUSIC__ I did! How crazy would it be to hear that song all the time knowing it was for you?"
"__MUSIC__ Indeed. Ok what else?"
"__MUSIC__ Prince, Michael jackson, Madonna, Cydia Lauper, Talking Heads, Lionel Richie..."
"__MUSIC__ Oh I had forgotten about Talking Heads, thank you!"
"__MUSIC__ Don't forget hair metal. Def Leppard, Poison, Tesla, Skid Row"
"__MUSIC__ Oh yeah, I have all of those. And Van Halen too."
"__MUSIC__ Definitely can't leave Van Halen out!"
