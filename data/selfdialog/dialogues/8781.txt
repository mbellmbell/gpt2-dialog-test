"__BEATLES__ Did you know I've never listened to The Beatles?"
"__BEATLES__ What? Are you joking?"
"__BEATLES__ Nope! Dead serious."
"__BEATLES__ Not even, on accident or something? They play on the radio all the time!"
"__BEATLES__ Nah man, I only listen to Top 40."
"__BEATLES__ Yikes...that's a choice."
"__BEATLES__ Okay whatever, enough judgement. Which Beatles songs would you recommend?"
"__BEATLES__ I guess my favorite would have to be Piggy's."
"__BEATLES__ This was a trick, man! I love The Beatles and you just picked their worst song."
"__BEATLES__ Aw what the heck man? Not cool! Piggy's is a good song..."
