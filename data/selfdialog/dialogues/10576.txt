"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Which rapper has the most creative lyrics?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's got to be Eminem.  Some of the stuff he comes up with is insane!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I don't know.  Insane might be the right word because the dude is nuts."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Very true. But who else can say stuff like, 'my noodle is cockadoodledoo, my clocks cuckoo, I got screws loose, yeah the whole kit and caboodle' and get away with it?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ It's true. He can seem to get away with some funny stuff that wouldn't work for other rappers."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Maybe it's his slim shady persona that makes it work."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ By the way, what album are those lyrics from?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ The 8 mile soundtrack.  It's one of his best."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ That's right. The movie was good too."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I agree. It was better than I expected it to be."
