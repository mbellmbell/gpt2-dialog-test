"__MOVIES__ I miss parody films. I wish they'd come back."
"__MOVIES__ We still have parody movies."
"__MOVIES__ I mean good ones, like in the old days. Airplane and movies like that."
"__MOVIES__ We just got Scary Movie 5 a few years ago."
"__MOVIES__ And it was terrible, even compared to the other Movie films."
"__MOVIES__ The other Scary Movie films weren't bad, were they?"
"__MOVIES__ No. Though, the first two had a different style from the third and fourth."
"__MOVIES__ Why did they change?"
"__MOVIES__ After the first two movies, David Zucker who had worked on movies like Airplane and Top Secret! took over."
"__MOVIES__ Oh, that guy. Didn't he also do the Naked Gun movies?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, along with Jim Abrahams. Personally, I always thought Abrahams was the better of the three."
"__MOVIES__ The three? Who else was there?"
"__MOVIES__ There was also David Zucker's brother, Jerry Zucker. He made Rat Race."
"__MOVIES__ Rat Race, huh? Yeah, I guess I can see his style in that."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but like I said, Abrahams was the best of the three, even though they all worked together on a lot of their films."
"__MOVIES__ What movies is he responsible for?"
"__MOVIES__ Only the two best spoof movies ever; Hot Shots!, and Hot Shots! Part Deux."
"__MOVIES__ Heh. They definitely don't make them like that anymore."
"__MOVIES__ No, instead we get things like Meet the Spartans, and we hardly even get movies like those anymore."
"__MOVIES__ Maybe spoof movies are just a thing of the past."
