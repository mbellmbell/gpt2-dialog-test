"__STAR_WARS__ So did you see the preview for The Last Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, that was awesome.  It's going to be a great movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Do you think they'll tell us who Rey's parents are?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I do, but my theory is a little bit different.  I think she gets her Jedi blood from the Kenobi blood line."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be amazing!  And a surprise.  What about Snoke?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I would love to see who he is.  Maybe he's someone we already know."
"__STAR_WARS__ I heard a theory that it could be Mace Windu."
"__STAR_WARS__ That would be great, he exited way too easy."
"__STAR_WARS__ For the heck of it bring back Darth Maul too."
"__STAR_WARS__ I'm not sure about that.  He was cool but lets not be too far fetched."
