"__MUSIC__ So, I just heard that Childish Gambino said his next album will be his last."
"__MUSIC__ No! He's retiring from rapping?"
"__MUSIC__ I don't think so, I think maybe he's just retiring the alter-ego Childish Gambino."
"__MUSIC__ So do you think he'll just rap as Donald Glover now?"
"__MUSIC__ That's exactly what I think he's going to do."
"__MUSIC__ I miss the old Childish Gambino rap style."
"__MUSIC__ Same. I was such a fan of his old stuff that his newest album made me really sad."
"__MUSIC__ I can appreciate his new album, but I find myself going back to his older stuff more often."
"__MUSIC__ Well, hopefully if he does start releasing things under Donald Glover, he brings back the old sound."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder what he's do if he stopped rapping?"
"__MUSIC__ He's got a pretty decent acting career going on, so he might just go back to that."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if that's because he's a connection to Hollywood."
"__MUSIC__ I'm confused, what do you mean a connection?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, his dad. Danny Glover."
"__MUSIC__ Danny Glover isn't Donald Glover's dad!"
"__MUSIC__ Are you sure? I swear someone told me that."
"__MUSIC__ I don't doubt that someone told you that, but its not true."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, that's a bummer. I actually thought it was kind of neat."
"__MUSIC__ I guess that would be kinda cool, if it were true, but no, it isn't."
"__MUSIC__ Oh well thanks for telling me! I'm glad I never said anything to anyone else about it."
