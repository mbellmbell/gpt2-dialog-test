"__STAR_WARS__ So who is your favorite character from Star Wars?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Hands down I have got to say it's Luke Skywalker."
"__STAR_WARS__ No way! Han Solo is the best."
"__STAR_WARS__ But Luke is a Jedi, he can use the force and a light saber.  That is so much cooler."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah but Han Solo has a the fastest ship in the galaxy and hangs out with a Wookie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Luke Skywalker is the first Jedi to come around in a generation.  He can move objects with his mind."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han Solo has that bad boy thing going for him.  Luke Skywalker is too squeaky clean for me."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's a hero!  He dedicates his life to taking down the Empire.  Han Solo tries to cut and run every chance he gets."
"__STAR_WARS__ Han didn't have to take on the Empire like he did in Return of the Jedi, he had his own ship, he could have just left."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's true, but no one could have done what Luke did.  No one could have taken on the Emperor and gotten Darth Vadar to turn away from the dark side."
