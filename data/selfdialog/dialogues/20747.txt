"__THRILLER__ Hey, have a ever seen the movie The Purge?"
"__THRILLER__ No, I've heard a little about it, but don't know that much about it. What can you tell me about it."
"__THRILLER__ The Purge is set in a near future AMerica where unemployment  and crime are at all time lows, and the economy is very strong."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, sounds good, but being this is a thriller, I'm thinking there's a catch?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, all this is due to the The Purge, an annual 12 hopur period where all crime is legal and emergency and police serivces are unavailable."
"__THRILLER__ All crime is legal, even murder?"
"__THRILLER__ For the movie, particularly murder. The government was taken over by the so-called New Founding Fathers of America, a totalitarian party that used an econmic collapse to rise to power."
"__THRILLER__ So, people can butcher each other wholesale for a 12 hour period once a year?"
"__THRILLER__ Yes, but weapons like explosives or rocket launchers are forbidden and government official above a certain level are exempt, on penalty of summary execution."
"__THRILLER__ Okay, soound's violent and crazy. I'll probably love it, thanks for the info."
