"__HARRY_POTTER__ What's your favorite scene in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I love the Yule Ball scene."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I like that one too, but it makes me mad when Ron ruins the whole thing for Hermione."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He was kind of a jerk to her in that movie. Neither him nor Harry thought she could get a date."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ And then she ends up being asked by Viktor Krum, the most famous guy at the school!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I think Ron's just jealous because he secretly loves Hermione."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ He really does love her, but they don't even kiss until the end of the Deathly Hallows Part 2."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I was kind of surprised that they ended up together."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Really? I think they make a good couple. Definitely better than Harry and Ginny."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Oh, I know. Ginny is the most boring character in the entire series."
