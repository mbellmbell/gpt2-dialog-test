"__BASKETBALL__ What do you feel is the most overrated NCAA conference in basketball?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Mens or womens?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Mens of course. The womens are all the same."
"__BASKETBALL__ Again, you're sexist. I'd have to say the American conference."
"__BASKETBALL__ What? Why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, their two premiere teams are usually Cincinnati and UConn, neither of whom have done anything in a while"
"__BASKETBALL__ UConn just won the title a few years ago!"
"__BASKETBALL__ True, but that was as a 7-seed. They haven't been dominant."
"__BASKETBALL__ Elaborate."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, the past few years has seen Memphis, Houston, ECU, UConn, and Cincinnati all being highly-ranked, and temple being respected as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ So?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, with the exception of UConn, no one has done well on the national stage. They play well, then bomb in the tournament."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, that's true, Their non-conference schedules are weak as well."
"__BASKETBALL__ So, your choice?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Big Ten for sure."
"__BASKETBALL__ Why?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, everyone keeps saying they're one of the strongest because of MSU, Wisconsin, and OSU's recent strong seasons, but no titles."
"__BASKETBALL__ Well, Wisconsin was robbed against Duke, that's pretty much been proven."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah. Indiana and Maryland are also supposed to be strong schools but always fade in the tournament."
"__BASKETBALL__ It's like the Big Ten and American are great regular-season conferences, but awful in the tournament."
