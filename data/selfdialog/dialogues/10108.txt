"__RAP_HIPHOP__ So how did you first start listening to rap?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Well I just knew that I wanted to because my family had never exposed me to it, so I thought I'd start with Tupac as a safe bet since evryone seemed to like him."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Makes sense. So that made you want to listen to more."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Exactly."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Do you still listen to him?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, partly because of the good memories of that being my first exposure to hip hop, partly because it was a time frame where life was relatively happy."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ But you like something about him specifically, otherwise you wouldn't have delved into more of it, right?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I mean his voice doesn't do anything for me..."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Man, I love his distinctive voice!"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah, strictly sound wise his music doesn't do a whole lot for me either.. just constructually, the way his lyrics are formatted and story-wise that's what got me, being able to follow a linear story."
