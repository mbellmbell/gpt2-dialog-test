"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie?"
"__DISNEY__ My favorite of all time is The Little Mermaid."
"__DISNEY__ I like that one, too! Sebastian is my favorite character!"
"__DISNEY__ I like him, too. And Scuttle."
"__DISNEY__ Scuttle was a little annoying to me."
"__DISNEY__ Really? I think he wasn't the brightest, but had the best intentions when helping Ariel."
"__DISNEY__ King Triton was really strict, but he had to be with Ursula lurking around."
"__DISNEY__ She was a creepy villain. When she grew to a huge size and stirred the sea, that was scary."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. I liked the ending when King Triton let Ariel and Eric be together."
"__DISNEY__ That was nice. I know there's a sequel the The Little Mermaid, but I haven't ever seen it."
