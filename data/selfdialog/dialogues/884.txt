"__MUSIC__ Hey what do you think about dub step?"
"__MUSIC__ I have mixed feelings about dub step honestly."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ Well on one end of the spectrum I think it's terrible and on the other I think it's great."
"__MUSIC__ Ok explain each side of the spectrum for me."
"__MUSIC__ Ok sure. Take a dub step song by itself. It just sounds terrible most of the time."
"__MUSIC__ Alright and the other?"
"__MUSIC__ When dub step is combines with a good song it always sounds awesome."
"__MUSIC__ Ah I see so you like mashed dub step songs and not actual dub step."
"__MUSIC__ Thats exactly right. I think dub step on it's own is just noise."
"__MUSIC__ I feel the same way actually. I don't enjoy dub step unless it's paired with a song I like."
"__MUSIC__ I just don't see the appeal if it's not paird with anything."
"__MUSIC__ I agree."
"__MUSIC__ I wonder if there are any individuals who feel the opposite in terms of our opinion."
"__MUSIC__ I can't say anyone I know actually likes dub step."
"__MUSIC__ I have a few friends that do but they are just like me."
"__MUSIC__ They don't like it unless it's paired with another song?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah exactly."
"__MUSIC__ I can't argue with em. I've tried listening to straight dub step and I just couldn't get into it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it's just awful."
