"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ are you ready for some football?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ oh I'm ready for some football alright!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ it seems like even though the season starts a little bit earlier every year, the off season seems long an unbearable"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know, right. I always get a little bit depressed after the super bowl, as I know i will be without football for over 6 months"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ hey, do you know where the super bowl is this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ this upcoming year its going to be in Minneapolis Minnesota"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I guess that means there is no way the vikings are going to be in the super bowl this time then"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ why do you say that?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ well the team of the super bowl host city almost never makes it to the super bowl"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ how many times has that even happened?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ its only happened twice"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ that's it it? who were the teams that went"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The san francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XIX. but they played in Stanford Stadium and not Candlestick. The other team to play the super bowl in their home market was the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl XIV."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The rams played that one in the Rose Bowl, and not the Memorial Coliseum"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ they lost that game too, to the steelers. can you imagine that, losing the big game while in your own back yard?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ did the 49ers win super bowl XIX"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ they did indeed"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ go 9ers!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I wonder who the next team will be to play the super bowl in their home market"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ who knows, it may never happen in our lifetime"
