"__STAR_WARS__ Who is the greatest Sith? Other than Vader, that's too easy."
"__STAR_WARS__ Darth Maul is my favorite."
"__STAR_WARS__ He's not that powerful in the force though. His skill is all sword play."
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't agree. It would take incredible force powers to master his double sword."
"__STAR_WARS__ Maybe, but he doesn't seem to use any other force techniques with any regularity."
"__STAR_WARS__ Like what?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Force push, force choke, force jump, things like that."
"__STAR_WARS__ Does anyone other than Darth Vader?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Kylo Ren uses force moves quite a bit. Remember when he stopped that laser blast in mid-air?"
"__STAR_WARS__ That was cool. Do you think he is more powerful than Vader?"
