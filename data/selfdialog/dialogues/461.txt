"__MUSIC__ Wow! The new Burial album is just incredible!"
"__MUSIC__ Who is Burial?"
"__MUSIC__ You don't know who Burial is?"
"__MUSIC__ I've never heard of him. Tell me more."
"__MUSIC__ Burial is the pioneering artist of Future Garage music. It features scattered broken beats, dark bass-lines, and soulful vocals."
"__MUSIC__ Sound pretty interesting!"
"__MUSIC__ It is definitely my favorite music genre, and Burial is probably still the best."
"__MUSIC__ What albums are a good place to start? I am really interested now!"
"__MUSIC__ Personally I would recommend the album, 'Untrue' because it really has something to suit most tastes in music, and is a really solid work of art."
"__MUSIC__ You had me when you mentioned 'soulful vocals'. What are some stand out tracks from this album?"
"__MUSIC__ The one that most people know and love is called 'Archangel', which is a great introduction, but my personal favorite is Ghost Hardware because of the dark atmosphere."
"__MUSIC__ Dark music is something that I have always gravitated towards. Are the songs similar to say... Massive Attack?"
"__MUSIC__ In certain ways Burial reminds me of Massive Attack, but only a little bit. His sound is unique and unlike anything you have ever heard."
"__MUSIC__ Fantastic to hear that because I am a big fan of music like that."
"__MUSIC__ Now that you mentioned it, there is a Burial collaboration with Massive Attack called Paradise Circus."
"__MUSIC__ Oh my god! Why Have I not heard of this?"
"__MUSIC__ It's not really very well known, but I think that is one that you should look for."
"__MUSIC__ Thank you so much for the recommendations!"
"__MUSIC__ I'm always happy to help someone find new music."
"__MUSIC__ And I am always happy to discover new things!"
