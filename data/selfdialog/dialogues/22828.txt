"__DISNEY__ I have pictures to show you of my kids Trick or Treating last weekend."
"__DISNEY__ Oh how cute. MaryAnn looks adorable. What's her costume character?"
"__DISNEY__ She wanted to be Princess Jasmine from the Disney movie Aladdin."
"__DISNEY__ Her costume is beautiful."
"__DISNEY__ Thanks, I made the costume for her."
"__DISNEY__ Wow, it's nice. Was it hard to make?"
"__DISNEY__ No, not at all. The Disney website had costume ideas and directions on what to get to make the costume."
"__DISNEY__ How long did it take to make it?"
"__DISNEY__ About 45 minutes. MaryAnn loves it so much she wants to keep it to play dress-up in."
"__DISNEY__ I didn't see Aladdin, but the costume is beautiful."
