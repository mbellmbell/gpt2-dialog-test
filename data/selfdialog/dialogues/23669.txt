"__DISNEY__ What is your favorite Disney movie of all time?"
"__DISNEY__ That's such a hard question!"
"__DISNEY__ I know right? Mine would have to be a tie between The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast."
"__DISNEY__ Both good options. But what about Mulan?"
"__DISNEY__ Oh I forgot about Mulan. I didn't own it growing up."
"__DISNEY__ I did. It was one of my favorites. We had so many great movies growing up."
"__DISNEY__ We got the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Mulan, The Lion King."
"__DISNEY__ Emperor's New Groove - and of course, Toy Story."
"__DISNEY__ Toy Story! Oh I forgot about that one."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah, we sure were spoiled with Disney movies."
