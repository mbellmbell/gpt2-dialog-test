"__MUSIC__ What is your favorite form in classical music?"
"__MUSIC__ Do you mean 1750-1825 or art music in general."
"__MUSIC__ Stop being a snob. Art in general."
"__MUSIC__ Then, definitely the fugue."
"__MUSIC__ What's a fugue?"
"__MUSIC__ That's when you take a short idea, like one or two measures long, and subject it to a ton of crazy counterpoint."
"__MUSIC__ Like what?"
"__MUSIC__ You transpose the theme all over the place, you can invert it, augment it, diminute it, have many at the same time."
"__MUSIC__ That doesn't sound hard."
"__MUSIC__ Trust me, it's insanely tough."
"__MUSIC__ How so?"
"__MUSIC__ There are so many elements that go into it. It's kind of the height of compositional prowess."
"__MUSIC__ Would I recognize any?"
"__MUSIC__ Probably not. Wait, it's been in a movie."
"__MUSIC__ Which?"
"__MUSIC__ Home alone - there's a short fugue when Kevin is preparing the house."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, go back and listen to it. The theme comes back three times, I think, before going somewhere else."
"__MUSIC__ I'll be sure to listen to it."
"__MUSIC__ It's pretty awesome, one of my favorites."
