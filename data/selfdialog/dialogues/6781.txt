"__STAR_WARS__ So who are some of your favorite minor characters in the Star Wars films?"
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean, those kind of walk-on, wordless cameo aliens? I have a couple."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, like the guys they made action figures of but aren't really onscreen for very long."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, I've always been fascinated by the other bounty hunters in the lineup with Boba Fett."
"__STAR_WARS__ You mean, at Cloud City?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally! I mean, we have Dengar, who is this kind of dirty, grizzled looking guy covered in bandages, with maybe mechanical limbs..."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh yeah, and 4-LOM, who looks sort of like an evil insectoid C-3PO."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah, it's such a great visual."
"__STAR_WARS__ And Bossk, the kind of reptilian fellow in a spacesuit, who looks nasty and ravenous."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes! It's like, they're only onscreen for a few seconds but you want to know more about them all!"
