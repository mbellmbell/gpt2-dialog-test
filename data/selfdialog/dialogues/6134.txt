"__STAR_WARS__ Something bugs me about Star Wars."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, me too, but what is it?"
"__STAR_WARS__ So, they are traveling in hyperspace, sometimes for LONG periods of time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and?"
"__STAR_WARS__ And they have to eat."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes, and?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Some of them are in super tiny planes by themselves."
"__STAR_WARS__ Get to the point."
"__STAR_WARS__ How do they use the bathroom? They don't have space suits like astronauts do."
"__STAR_WARS__ That's disgusting but a good point. They probably have a tiny airplane-sized room and have to be super careful. Or, they disintegrate it using the force."
