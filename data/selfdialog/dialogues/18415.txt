"__MOVIES__ I was on a date with a girl last night, and she told me she had never seen any of the original Star Wars movies."
"__MOVIES__ How can that be?"
"__MOVIES__ She said that they felt too slow for her as a kid."
"__MOVIES__ Are you going to watch them then?"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, I was going to try to make it happen."
"__MOVIES__ Seems like a good third or fourth date."
"__MOVIES__ Exactly. And I feel like they're such a cultural touchstone."
"__MOVIES__ Like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings."
"__MOVIES__ Right. If you haven't seen them, so many jokes just go over your head."
"__MOVIES__ That's definitely true."
"__MOVIES__ Which is your favorite?"
"__MOVIES__ Definitely Empire."
"__MOVIES__ Everyone always says that. Why?"
"__MOVIES__ I think it's the most complicated of the three. It's gripping."
"__MOVIES__ Hmm. I get that, but I've always liked Return of the Jedi best."
"__MOVIES__ Why? It's so predictable."
"__MOVIES__ Yeah, but a predictable movie isn't a bad one. It's a satisfying ending."
"__MOVIES__ I don't know, I really prefer to be hooked the whole time."
"__MOVIES__ I guess that's fine. Either way, I'm starting with A New Hope."
"__MOVIES__ Can't go wrong there."
