"__HARRY_POTTER__ So which was your least favorite harry potter?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I would say the first one.  I mean it was still good, but a little childish."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yeah I know what you mean.  I like the later ones where people start to die, and they start dealing with crushes."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I did like however how they made it to grow up with the child.  As the movies go on they deal with more adult issues."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Like jealousy between Rob and Harry over Harmine, even though her and Harry never have anything going on."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Or the death of friends, showing that not everyone gets out alive when it comes to all out wizard wars."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ The best one I thought though was the Goblet of Fire."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes, I like when Voldemort came back.  The guy is ten kinds of creepy."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Especially with that snake of his."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I know, the snake is pretty tough in it's own right tough."
