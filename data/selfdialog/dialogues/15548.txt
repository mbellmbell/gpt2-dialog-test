"__HARRY_POTTER__ How did you get into watching the Harry Potter movies?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I just randomly saw a part of one of the original movies and I thought it was really cool.  I ended up renting the ones that were out at the time and I was hooked!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too!  At the time, I think it was just the first two that were already out on dvd.  Of course when the others came to theaters, I went and saw them on day one!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too!  I now have them all on blu-ray which makes them even better!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Me too!  I'm actually sad that they have ended!  I loved how it ended though!  Lord Voldemort got his behind handed to him!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Yes he did!  The Deathly Hallows part two was definitely my all time favorite movie of the series!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ Mine too!  They ended those movies so good!  Have you read any of the books?"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I have!  Believe it or not, the books are even better!"
"__HARRY_POTTER__ I've heard that!  They say that about a lot of your book made movies.  They always say the books are better."
"__HARRY_POTTER__ They really are especially in the case of the Harry Potter books.  There is so much more going on in them."
