"__COMEDY__ Hey, do you like comedy movies?"
"__COMEDY__ Of course!"
"__COMEDY__ Have you ever seen Spaceballs?"
"__COMEDY__ No, why?"
"__COMEDY__ Well it's an old movie but one of my favorite comedies.  It's a Mel Brooks movie."
"__COMEDY__ Oh, I love Mel Brooks.  History of the World Part I was hilarious."
"__COMEDY__ Yeah, he definitely makes great movies.  But Rick Moranis in Spaceballs was hysterical."
"__COMEDY__ Well, if it's by Mel Brooks, it has to be good!"
"__COMEDY__ It's worth it, I promise!"
"__COMEDY__ I'll check it out."
