"__DISNEY__ Holes is a movie all about luck, wouldn't you say?"
"__DISNEY__ What do you mean?"
"__DISNEY__ Well, luck comes into every single part of that movie."
"__DISNEY__ What's an example?"
"__DISNEY__ Like bad luck when Zero throws those shoes on Stanley Yelnats' head."
"__DISNEY__ Yeah I guess so."
"__DISNEY__ And good luck when they come across that water and onions on God's thumb after climbing the mountain."
"__DISNEY__ That also was about luck I guess."
"__DISNEY__ In the end, Stanley and Zero got all good luck basically."
"__DISNEY__ And Mr. Sir got TERRIBLE luck. Haha"
