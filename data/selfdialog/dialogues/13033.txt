"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't wait for the football season to start back up! Are you excited?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Definitely!  I've been keeping up with the Dallas Cowboys all summer."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too.  I think Dak Prescott will be just as good if not better this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I do too.  What the Cowboys needed to do this offseason was strengthen their defense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I totally agree with that.  Their offense was extremely good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think they kept most of their offense.  I do think they added some defense to the roster."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ After watching some college games, I hope they added some players from Alabama!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That, or made some trades with Green Bay.  They had a good defense last year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ They really did.  Do you know who they got for defense?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can't think of any names off the top of my head.  You know, I think they should hire Demarcus Ware as a coach though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah!  He's fantastic!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So who do you see in the superbowl?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Without seeing a preseason game I would say Dallas and Denver.  You?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree with Dallas for the NFC and I'd put Houston as the AFC side."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ That would be cool! A totally Texas superbowl!  I'm not sure if Houston is that good though."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You never know with them.  I do know they've made a lot of changes to their team."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I still think Denver would get the AFC side.  I know Peyton's not their anymore but they are still good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Denver takes a lot of former Dallas players so that is what makes them good.  I wonder who their quarterback is."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know but I'm excited to find out.  I know preseason is only preseason but I'm still going to watch all of the games that I can!"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too!  August can't get here soon enough!"
