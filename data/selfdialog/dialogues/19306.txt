"__MOVIES__ I saw the silliest movie ever the other day."
"__MOVIES__ I see silly movies all the time.  Help me out here."
"__MOVIES__ I'll give you a hint: it involves killer cell phones."
"__MOVIES__ Killer cell phones?  What are you talking about?"
"__MOVIES__ I'm talking about the movie Cell."
"__MOVIES__ Never heard of it.  Explain more."
"__MOVIES__ It was actually based off of a Stephen King novel."
"__MOVIES__ Okay, I'm actually interested.  King has some pedigree."
"__MOVIES__ Here's the thing: they butchered his novel and made this super horrible movie."
"__MOVIES__ Who's in it?"
"__MOVIES__ John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson?"
"__MOVIES__ Really?  They signed up for that garbage?"
"__MOVIES__ Guess they needed their paychecks.  After all, this is killer cell phones they're after."
"__MOVIES__ Explain the plot more to me.  I just don't understand."
"__MOVIES__ So cell phones end up sending out this tone that drives people crazy and leads them to kill one another."
"__MOVIES__ Sounds completely ridiculous."
"__MOVIES__ It certainly is.  The movie is even worse in how they try and fight it and restore humanity."
"__MOVIES__ I just can't wrap my head around why any serious actor would think this was a good idea."
"__MOVIES__ Sometimes you gotta do things to keep in the spotlight, I guess."
"__MOVIES__ Not if that spotlight highlights you're poor choice in movie roles."
