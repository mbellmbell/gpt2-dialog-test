"__MUSIC__ Did you see Come From Away on the Tonys?"
"__MUSIC__ I didn't watch them this year."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, you totally missed out!"
"__MUSIC__ Which one is Come From Away?"
"__MUSIC__ It's the one about the people stranded in Newfoundland on 9/11."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, right with the redirected planes?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They performed their opening number and it was awesome!"
"__MUSIC__ Oh? What did you like about it?"
"__MUSIC__ Well first of all it was a total foot-stomper. The music was spot on for Newfoundland."
"__MUSIC__ How so? I don't know the place."
"__MUSIC__ Well think about it like this. Celtic-Canadian island music."
"__MUSIC__ Ok so fiddles and beats and people with accents?"
"__MUSIC__ Exactly! One of the girls in the number actually pulls out a fiddle in the middle of the song."
"__MUSIC__ That's great!"
"__MUSIC__ It really was. The song was totally ensemble driven too."
"__MUSIC__ It didn't have a lead?"
"__MUSIC__ Well a couple of people sang more solo parts than the rest but it was a cast number. Lots of people soloed."
"__MUSIC__ I heard that the whole show was like that."
"__MUSIC__ It's definitely an ensemble show, and if the rest of the songs are anything like that one the energy is High!"
"__MUSIC__ Awesome! I'll have to look up the performance on Youtube."
