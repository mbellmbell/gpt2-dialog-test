"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team in the NFC East do you think will be the most improved?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Eagles with their 2nd year QB and offseason additions."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Which team in the East you think will be worse than last year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ The Cowboys, I dont see them winning 13 games again."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ You think Carson Wentz is going to help the eagles make the playoffs this year?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah as long as he can stay healthy and the weapons around him are decent."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ What about Dak Prescott? You think he will be as efficient as last season?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so, they wont be as good because people will have scouted for him but he should be good."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think Elliott is going to dominate again, that offensive line is great."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I agree, that OLine is nasty and will continue to pave the way for Zeke."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who is going to be better, Wentz or Prescott?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Wentz easily. He has more athleticism."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ But what about last season? Wentz had more interceptions than touchdowns"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ When you have a makeshift OLine for most of the season and Dak has the best, you cant compare them just yet."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I can see where you coming from, the numbers are hard to miss though. Dak was better."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah he was better but he also had better talent around him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Dez and Zeke were really good so I guess what your saying makes some sense."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ It will change this year, the eagles went out and got some weapons."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Maybe we will see some more identical stats this year based on that."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I sure hope so. Eagles fans sure are hoping that as well."
