"__STAR_WARS__ Did you like The Phantom Menace?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No; JarJar Binks was annoying and Young Anakin Skywalker didn't act very well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh; I did think the acting of the Young Anakin was a little stiff, but JarJar was hilarious!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I guess, JarJar did get less annoying, to me, in the Clone Wars, mainly because he got less screen time."
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh ya, I did realize that. Now that you mention that, JarJar did play a pretty big role in Episode one, and by Reveng of the Sith, he was barely in the film at all."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ya. I wish we would have seen more of Jaba the Hutt and his backstory more."
"__STAR_WARS__ Kind of like they did with Jenga Fett?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Exactly, though the Fetts were always more popular than the Hutts to the majority of the audience"
"__STAR_WARS__ Right. It was interesting finding out where all the Clones, and in turn Stormtroopers came from in The Clone Wars"
"__STAR_WARS__ Totally, and maybe that explains why the Stromtroopers had such bad aim, it had something to do with the cloning process being duplicated for generations. *haha*"
