"__MUSIC__ Have you heard the new Gorillaz album, 'Humanz'?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes, it's great.  I love Damon Albarn's voice."
"__MUSIC__ And how cool that D.R.A.M. and Anthony Hamilton are part of it."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and De la Soul."
"__MUSIC__ Yes. I think so many people have been waiting for this album to come out."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's really political.  More political than it seems."
"__MUSIC__ I think it's kind of a reaction to the current world political climate, don't you?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  And the making of the album for them is always such a cool, creative process.  You could watch it on their instagram."
"__MUSIC__ I had no idea.  I had heard about the photo of Damon's floor being covered with the splices of Grace Jones' singing."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and he picked the best ones to create 'Charger', which is such an awesome song."
"__MUSIC__ I heard he was going to work with Liam Bailey, too, but he's not on the album."
"__MUSIC__ I think they did record together, but that song or songs didn't make it to the album."
"__MUSIC__ Did you know that 'Andromeda' was written about Damon Albarn's girlfriend's mother?  She had just died when they started making the album."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't know that.  Is his girlfriend someone famous?"
"__MUSIC__ Not a musician, but she's a painter.  I think she might be famous in the U.K."
"__MUSIC__ Cool.  I heard that 'Andromeda' was kind of inspired by the sound of Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' album."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, and some 80's Hall and Oates song, too, 'I Can't Go For That.'"
"__MUSIC__ I'm not a big Hall and Oates fan"
"__MUSIC__ I like their 70's music."
"__MUSIC__ 'She's Gone' is an all right tune."
