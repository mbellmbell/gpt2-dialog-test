"__MUSIC__ Do you listen to Gorillaz?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. I have not gotten the new album yet, though."
"__MUSIC__ Oh, they have a new one out?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. It's called Humanz."
"__MUSIC__ Oh. Have you read any reviews?"
"__MUSIC__ Just a bunch of people on Facebook complaining that the new Gorillaz album doesn't sound like Gorillaz. Those kind of comments are best ignored."
"__MUSIC__ Why?"
"__MUSIC__ Because Gorillaz is a collaborative band. It has an ever-changing group of contributing artists and no particular, set-in-stone sound. It is meant to be somewhat fluid."
"__MUSIC__ I see what you mean."
"__MUSIC__ It bothers me that long-time 'fans' would diss the album so quickly. The day it came out fans were already complaining. I don't think that's cool. Sometimes you have to let things grow on you."
"__MUSIC__ What's your favorite album?"
"__MUSIC__ I love the first album most of all. The one with the song Clint Eastwood and Rock the House."
"__MUSIC__ I like Demon Dayz."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, that's a good one, too."
"__MUSIC__ I didn't even know that they were still around. I wasn't expecting a new album."
"__MUSIC__ I know. It's been a long time. I'm excited to buy it."
"__MUSIC__ I'm excited to see the new animations."
"__MUSIC__ When I first saw their videos, my mind was totally blown. The animation work is beyond amazing."
"__MUSIC__ I agree. I also really like that their albums are so conceptual and thematic."
"__MUSIC__ Yeah. They are a really fun, creative band. I look forward to seeing and hearing the new stuff."
