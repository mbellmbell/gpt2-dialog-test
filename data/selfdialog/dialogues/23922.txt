"__SUPERHERO__ Are you excited for Thanos to finally appear?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I am, and I'm not.  They've been building to this showdown since pretty much the first Iron Man."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, Spider-Man just stopping a mugger seems mundane after that."
"__SUPERHERO__ So, where do they go after Infinity War?"
"__SUPERHERO__ Maybe introduce a new super villain, like Kang."
"__SUPERHERO__ Yeah, that would be cool.  A lot of the actors' contract will probably expired around then."
"__SUPERHERO__ I wonder what will happen there?  Are they going to get a new Captain America?  A new Iron Man?"
"__SUPERHERO__ I wonder if they'll get a new actor to play 'Tony Stark,' or they'll get a new character with a new actor."
"__SUPERHERO__ It's a shame because all the actors they've cast have really done a great job.  Chris Evans, Robert Downey, jr, Samuel L. Jackson."
"__SUPERHERO__ Did you know they based the Ultimate Nick Fury on Sam Jack, and then he went on to play him in the movies."
