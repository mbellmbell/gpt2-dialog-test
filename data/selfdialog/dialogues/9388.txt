"__BASEBALL__ Do you know much about the history of baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Not really. Baseball really isn't my thing."
"__BASEBALL__ How can you not like baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Well, every time I'm forced to go to a game, everything feels the same every play, unless someone hits a homerun or something."
"__BASEBALL__ There's a lot more to baseball than hitting the most homeruns, and if you understood that, you'd be a lot more engaged while you watched."
"__BASEBALL__ Well, enlighten me."
"__BASEBALL__ First of all, baseball is a game that takes an investment of knowledge to enjoy watching."
"__BASEBALL__ What does that mean? That doesn't sound very fun."
"__BASEBALL__ It's like food. You can eat food and not really think about it, or you can learn about food and gain a pallette and suddenly your world is blown wide open."
"__BASEBALL__ So it would be worth it for me to learn more about baseball?"
"__BASEBALL__ Definitely, because once you understand different batters' strengths and weaknesses, and you know the pitchers as well, their game becomes much more exciting."
"__BASEBALL__ Isn't it just throwing the ball and trying to hit it over and over again?"
"__BASEBALL__ No! The pitchers know the batters, and know how they hit. And the batters know the pitchers, and know how they throw. And then it becomes an exciting duel!"
"__BASEBALL__ I'd rather just watch professional wrestling and see people get thrown around."
"__BASEBALL__ You're unbelievable! Here, we're going to a baseball game right now!"
"__BASEBALL__ I can't, I have to watch my kid while my wife is out. We could turn on the TV and watch a game though."
"__BASEBALL__ Do it! I'll walk you through every detail, and you'll love it by the end of it. I haven't even talked about the pitcher getting tired yet."
"__BASEBALL__ Sound great. You grab some beers out of the fridge and I'll get the TV warmed up."
"__BASEBALL__ Hey, I'm back with the beer! Wait, where'd you go?!"
"__BASEBALL__ I'm running out of the house to get away from you and baseball!"
