"__MOVIES__ Hey are you going to see Alien Covenant this weekend"
"__MOVIES__ I am considering it but i am not sure since the last movie was weak"
"__MOVIES__ The last movie was not that bad though."
"__MOVIES__ It was not horrible but it was such a letdown."
"__MOVIES__ I mean i guess it could be considered a let down"
"__MOVIES__ It certainly was not great"
"__MOVIES__ Well yeah i can agree it was not great at least"
"__MOVIES__ Yeah and i am fearful the new one is just as bad"
"__MOVIES__ From what i hear in the reviews it is much better"
"__MOVIES__ Oh yeah? What have the reviews said?"
"__MOVIES__ They said that the movie was actually good and scary"
"__MOVIES__ That is a relief as the last one was not at all."
"__MOVIES__ The only down side is some of the people from that movie seem to return."
"__MOVIES__ Well shame they should have just forgot about them"
"__MOVIES__ I agree they were part of the reason it was not that good"
"__MOVIES__ Do they seem to be portrayed better?"
"__MOVIES__ They sound like they are a step up in acting"
"__MOVIES__ i am a bit more positive about that then"
"__MOVIES__ Lets give it a shot i will pay"
"__MOVIES__ Well then cannot say no if you are paying."
