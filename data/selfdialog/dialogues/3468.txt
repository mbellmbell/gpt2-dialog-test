"__MUSIC__ I like her Holiday songs."
"__MUSIC__ Her Christmas albums were beautiful."
"__MUSIC__ Like 'All I want for Christmas is You'?"

"__MUSIC__ But, Beyonce can sing and perform."
"__MUSIC__ Mariah Carey also performs, she puts on a really amazing show."
"__MUSIC__ Do you think she is better than Whitney Houston?"
