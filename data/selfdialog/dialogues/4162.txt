"__MUSIC__ Is there any young musician or band that I ought to be keeping my eye on these days?"
"__MUSIC__ What do you mean?"
"__MUSIC__ Some up and comer who is on the verge of blowing up and becoming a huge star in the world of music."
"__MUSIC__ Ah, gotcha! Well, I'm not as plugged into the musical scene as I used to be."
"__MUSIC__ More than me, though! Ever since having a child, it's been tough to listen to music like I used to."
"__MUSIC__ OK, let me think. Do you know who Vince Staples is?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I've heard his stuff. He's good!"
"__MUSIC__ He's definitely good. Him, Earl, and Kendrick are part of a generation of really talented California rappers."
"__MUSIC__ I've definitely listened to a lot of Kendrick Lamar. Who is Earl, though?"
"__MUSIC__ Earl Sweatshirt. He was originally part of Odd Future, but has broken away to be a solo star."
"__MUSIC__ I'm not familiar with Odd Future either."
"__MUSIC__ Really? That's surprising, they've been semi-established for a few years now."
"__MUSIC__ Like, I said, when you've got a baby to deal with, music kind of recedes into the background a little."
"__MUSIC__ Fair enough. Odd Future is a collection of singers and rappers let by Tyler the Creator."
"__MUSIC__ OK, I know Tyler. And now that you mention it, I think I heard something about Frank Ocean being in a group with him."
"__MUSIC__ Yep, that's Odd Future. Anyway, Earl is probably the best MC out of the whole group."
"__MUSIC__ Better than Tyler, you'd say?"
"__MUSIC__ I would argue so."
"__MUSIC__ OK, if that's the case then I should give him a listen! Thanks."
"__MUSIC__ No problem, glad I could help you out."
