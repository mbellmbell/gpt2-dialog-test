"__STAR_WARS__ Did you see the most recent Star Wars Movie?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Oh, Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What? No. The Force Awakens."
"__STAR_WARS__ Did you not see the Rogue One?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No. When did that come out?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Last year. It was awesome."
"__STAR_WARS__ Wait. Was it the sequel to The Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ No... it is kind of weird I guess. It's just a story that takes place in the same universe."
"__STAR_WARS__ So it has nothing to do with Rey, or Poe from the Force Awakens?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Nope. That sequel comes out next year on December 15th."
