"__STAR_WARS__ Why are people always making fun of the Stormtroopers in the movies?"
"__STAR_WARS__ What do you mean?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Like in the original movies, about them not being able to shoot and hit anyone."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well, you have to admit, they destroy more walls than they actually hit anyone."
"__STAR_WARS__ True, but you do have to remember that they were trying to capture Han, Leia and Luke."
"__STAR_WARS__ They were?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Yes. They were trying to recapture them to get the plans back from them, and also to find out where the rebel base was."
"__STAR_WARS__ Why would they want the plans back?"
"__STAR_WARS__ Because the trio hadn't delivered the plans to the rebels yet. Without the plans, there is no attack on the Deathstar."
"__STAR_WARS__ Ok, so maybe the stormtroopers were better shots than people give them credit for."
