"__MOVIES__ I'm pretty sure that Braveheart is the best movie ever made!"
"__MOVIES__ That's kind of a bold statement."
"__MOVIES__ It's bold, but I just watched Braveheart for like the 20th time, and I'm fired up! FREEEEEEEEDOM!"
"__MOVIES__ It's a really good movie, don't get me wrong."
"__MOVIES__ How about the scene where the knights all charge on horseback, and they stop them with a pike wall?"
"__MOVIES__ Yep, that was awesome."
"__MOVIES__ Plus, that crazy Irish warrior guy for comic relief."
"__MOVIES__ It's a really good movie. It's not the best movie ever, though."
"__MOVIES__ Agree to disagree!"
"__MOVIES__ What about Citizen Kane?"
"__MOVIES__ Boring! I tried to watch it but fell asleep?"
"__MOVIES__ How about Pulp Fiction."
"__MOVIES__ Pulp Fiction is a fine movie, but it doesn't get the blood pumping like Braveheart."
"__MOVIES__ I heard the script from Braveheart was only 30 pages long."
"__MOVIES__ I believe it, because instead of boring dialogue it was packed with combat and battles and stuff."
"__MOVIES__ When I think of the dialogue of Pulp Fiction, it's hard for me to call that boring."
"__MOVIES__ There were some boring parts."
"__MOVIES__ Name one."
"__MOVIES__ OK, I guess it wasn't boring. But Braveheart is still better."
"__MOVIES__ They may take your life, but they'll never take your freedom to have terrible taste in movies!"
