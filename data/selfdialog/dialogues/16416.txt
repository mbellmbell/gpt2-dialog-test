"__ROCK__ wanna go to a rock concert?"
"__ROCK__ depends, who's playing?"
"__ROCK__ two of my favorite bands! metric and imagine dragons. some girl named halsey is opening."
"__ROCK__ halsey? haven't heard of her. metric is pretty good, though."
"__ROCK__ not a fan of imagine dragons?"
"__ROCK__ i could do without them. they remind me of twenty-one pilots. just some wannabe emo stuff."
"__ROCK__ yikes, okay. so i guess i won't invite you to the twenty-one pilots concert."
"__ROCK__ yeah, that's probably for the best."
"__ROCK__ what about metric, though?"
"__ROCK__ metric i can do. do you think they'll play lost kitten?"
