"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Didn't he perform at Jazzfest 3 years ago with Juvenile?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Yeah he did. Thomas and myself both went and saw the performance. It was great, Mannie is one of the greatest DJ's in the rap game."
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ Is he still producing music these days?"
"__RAP_HIPHOP__ I know he did some work with Lil Jon and Rick Ross not too long ago but he hasn't put out any solo stuff in a long time."
