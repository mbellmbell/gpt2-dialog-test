"__MUSIC__ Do you like the Doors?"
"__MUSIC__ Yes!  I learned about them watching that Oliver Stone move when I was a kid!"

"__MUSIC__ I like L.A. Woman."
"__MUSIC__ Me too.  My favorite is The Soft Parade."
"__MUSIC__ I haven't listened to that one much.  I heard a lot of people don't like it."
"__MUSIC__ It's definitely one that some people don't like.  Some people think it's too orchestral."
"__MUSIC__ I'll have to check it out."
"__MUSIC__ I also like Absolutely Live."
"__MUSIC__ Isn't that the one with Celebration of the Lizard on it."
"__MUSIC__ Yes.  I think that performance is classic Jim!"
"__MUSIC__ What do you think of American Prayer?"
"__MUSIC__ It's a little too much for me.  While interesting, it's more cacophony than music."
"__MUSIC__ I have that albumn; but, I don't listen to it much."

"__MUSIC__ Thy were way before my time too; but, I think it'll be a long time before people stop listening to them."
"__MUSIC__ Jim gets most of the attention; but, I think Manzarek is appreciated a lot too."

"__MUSIC__ No doubt!  Jim may have been the star; but, it took all four."
