"__DISNEY__ Have you gotten a chance to watch Moana yet?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes! I loved it so much! The music was awesome."
"__DISNEY__ I know! How far I'll Go is my favorite song. It was so deep."
"__DISNEY__ I know I don't live like her but I feel like I can relate so much! I bet lots of young girls feel that way, too."
"__DISNEY__ It's also cool that Dwayne Johnson played Maui. He made a great demigod."
"__DISNEY__ Is that who that was? I knew I recognized the voice! His song You're Welcome is so catchy."
"__DISNEY__ It's also a great story, don't you think?"
"__DISNEY__ Definitely. She had to be strong and follow her heart to save her tribe. Not a lot of Disney princesses do that!"
"__DISNEY__ They don't! And most Disney princesses meet a prince and fall in love, it's cool that she was independent."
"__DISNEY__ I agree. She's so inspirational for young girls!"
