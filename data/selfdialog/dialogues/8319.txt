"__POP__ Madonna is such a talented artist. It's a shame that her album sales have been so low."
"__POP__ Her last great album was Hard Candy. I don't even know any of the songs from Rebel Heart."
"__POP__ Hard Candy was amazing. I love the song 4 Minutes."
"__POP__ That song is so catchy, and anything with Justin Timberlake is a win."
"__POP__ Come to think of it I can't think of anything he's released recently."
"__POP__ Neither can I. The only songs I know of his are What Goes Around Comes Around and My Love."
"__POP__ I can't believe how long it's been since those songs were released!"
"__POP__ It's crazy, isn't it?"
"__POP__ Maybe Madonna and Justin should do another song together."
"__POP__ I would love to hear what they could come up with."
