"__MUSIC__ How's your Franz Liszt dissertation going?"
"__MUSIC__ I quit."
"__MUSIC__ Why? You love his music."
"__MUSIC__ I'm just not good enough from a music theory standpoint. I have nothing new to offer."
"__MUSIC__ Aren't you applying voice-leading and transformational graphs to discuss the harmonic areas?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, but I'm not able to keep up. I use techniques that are new to me, but actually five years old."
"__MUSIC__ Really?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, I presented at the New England Conference of Music Theorists last fall."
"__MUSIC__ You told me about that, it didn't go well, right?"
"__MUSIC__ Yeah, it was bad. They said 'It's a shame you didn't use the techniques we have.'"
"__MUSIC__ WOW, jerks. How'd you respond?"
"__MUSIC__ I said how I didn't like the three-dimensional models. They seemed to take offense."
"__MUSIC__ Why is that?"
"__MUSIC__ Well, those analytical techniques are specific to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Eastman."
"__MUSIC__ So?"
"__MUSIC__ I used techniques that originated from Chicago, their competition."
"__MUSIC__ Ahh, a music theory turf war."
"__MUSIC__ Yup, a bunch of 'need attention graduate students' who were saying 'I just learned about this technique last term, did you use it?'"
"__MUSIC__ Ha, snobs. How'd you respond?"
"__MUSIC__ I said 'No, I am allowed to not like it. I chose what works for me and how I view the music.'"
