"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So Ryan Tannenhill is returning for another season for Miami."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ So i see, looks like he's got some  good 2nd and 3rd string players as well."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Who are they?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, there is Matt More."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Oh yeah, he covered Tannenhill a lot last season."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember, Then there is David Fales."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ He's new, right?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I think so."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Brandon Dourghty is trying to make a play for third string."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Is he any good?"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I don't know, i never heard of him."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ hm."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, if they let Moore play even more this season i think getting to the playoffs won't be a problem."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I know. They got there last season but was shut down early."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ I remember. I was bummed out after seeing Jacksonville and Tampa not making it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yes, it's hard for Florida teams to make it to the playoffs and hold it."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Hopefully it will be different this year."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Well, i dont see Jacksonville making the grade."
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Yeah, hoping Miami makes it to the playoffs again this season"
"__NFL_FOOTBALL__ Me too!"
