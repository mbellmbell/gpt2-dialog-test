"__BASKETBALL__ Did you watch the playoff game, Spurs and Rockets?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, I haven't been following the series. What's going on with it?"
"__BASKETBALL__ Today, the Spurs won in overtime. The game was a bit ugly, but it was close and exciting."
"__BASKETBALL__ Was Harden getting a ton of free throws?"
"__BASKETBALL__ No, just a lot of turnovers and missed shots at the end."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, I guess that can happen with a team that shoots a ton of 3s."
"__BASKETBALL__ So the Spurs are up 3-2 now, but game 6 is in Houston."
"__BASKETBALL__ You think the Spurs will close it out or it will go to 7?"
"__BASKETBALL__ I think Houston probably wins at home, and then game 7 will be a toss-up."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, they seem pretty evenly matched from what I've seen."
"__BASKETBALL__ I thought the Spurs were in trouble when Tony Parker hurt his leg, but Patty Mills has filled in pretty well."
"__BASKETBALL__ Oh, I didn't realize he got hurt."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, out for the season. Nene on the Rockets got hurt too."
"__BASKETBALL__ Both older guys, that makes sense."
"__BASKETBALL__ I think either team is going to have to play out of their minds to beat the Warriors though."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, they're definitely another level above these teams."
"__BASKETBALL__ Plus they are resting right now, while these teams play 2-3 extra games."
"__BASKETBALL__ And you said this one went to overtime, so that's even more wear and tear."
"__BASKETBALL__ True, good point. That's the beauty of being a top seed, you're more likely to win quick and get more rest."
"__BASKETBALL__ Yeah, good call."
