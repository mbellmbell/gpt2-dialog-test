"__STAR_WARS__ Have you seen The return of the Jedi?"
"__STAR_WARS__ I did, about 20 years ago."
"__STAR_WARS__ It is a great movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ I think it was alright, but my favorite was the newest one, Rogue One."
"__STAR_WARS__ Well the Return of the Jedi was well made."
"__STAR_WARS__ I agree with you there, I like how they were in a forest for most of the movie."
"__STAR_WARS__ Yeah it was different than the rest of the movies at the time."
"__STAR_WARS__ I loved the little Ewoks that they introduced in the Return of the Jedi as well."
"__STAR_WARS__ Those guys were so cute!"
"__STAR_WARS__ I don't think so, I was just happy they helped the rebellion defeat the emperor."
