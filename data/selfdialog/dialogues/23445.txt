"__DISNEY__ Have you seen all the remakes of some of the Disney Classics?"
"__DISNEY__ Yes I did."
"__DISNEY__ Which ones were your favorite?"
"__DISNEY__ Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the beast, and Malificent which was suppose to be the Snow White remake."
"__DISNEY__ Those were my favorite too. I wish they would make one for Little Mermaid or Peter Pan."
"__DISNEY__ Those would be great Disney remakes."
"__DISNEY__ I think if they remade The Little mermaid the part where she turns her fin into legs would be the most crucial part."
"__DISNEY__ I disagree, I think the part where she needs to kiss the prince before the sunset would be."
"__DISNEY__ You're right, I think Jessica CHastain would make a great Ariel and Henry Cavil as Prince Eric."
"__DISNEY__ Both great choices! I agree."
